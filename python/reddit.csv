"It's possible to write that elegant code only off the back of very ugly and obscure code.  Have a look at some newer C++14 library code, heck have a look at the upcoming ranges proposal.  Using the proposed std::range is very convenient and elegant, but actually developing std::range is tedious, full of ugly hacks involving obscure concepts like expression SFINAE.

Also due to the inherent complexity of C++ it's also very fragile; consider that a couple of weeks ago an unintended consequence of how constexpr mixes with templates and mixes with decltypes in expression SFINAE causes very straight forward and sensible code to break resulting in library code having to jump through hoops you wouldn't even believe were possible.

The end result of this is that things one would expect to be fairly basic and commonplace in the standard library, like a way to work with ranges, networking, compression, just basic abstractions end up being things that only a handful of people can implement properly, and not because people lack a conceptual understanding of these abstractions but because very few people want to fight against the C++ compiler.

"&gt;CO2 has been proven to follow rises in temperature, not precede it.

That's a blatantly false claim at worst (abrupt climate change) and misleading at best (climate change). 

(Worst) While some studies have shown an increase in CO2 *after* a rise in temperature this is typically due to resolution of the data. Upon acquisition of higher resolution the previous claims of a rise in temperature and *then* a rise in CO2 are disproven. CO2 is without a doubt [the main driver](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2014/10/29/new-study-shows-three-abrupt-pulses-of-co2-during-last-deglaciation/) behind *abrupt* climate change. See Jim White's presentation at AGU 2015 on Abrupt Climate Change.

(Best) While temperature variations caused by internal variability, changing wind patterns, Milankovitch cycles, etc. certainly play a role in longer term fluctuations (century to millennial scale) they don't appear to be able to generate decadal scale forcings on par with GHG. Note from the above hyperlink: 

&gt;The overall rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the last deglaciation was thought to have been triggered by the release of CO2 from the deep ocean – especially the Southern Ocean. But the century-scale events must involve a different mechanism that can act faster... 

Analogously, think of the oceans as a lighter. Internal variability as the wick, and CO2 as the explosive. A simple but poor analogy I know, but it should help drive the point home, regardless.

"So the rete in opah is actually within the gills, not before. It serves as an internal heater within the gills to warm up the blood that gets oxygenated at the gills that is then sent to the rest of the body. In this way the opah is able to keep its entire body ""warm-blooded."" Another bonus point for having the rete at the gills is because the blood goes from the gills to the heart. Warmer blood at the heart means it can pump faster - so better circulation to the rest of the tissues. 

And this brings up a good point - the gills are a limiting factor for endothermy in fishes because its directly exposed to the water and all of that blood that passes the gills then gets cold before getting sent to the rest of the body. This is why tunas, sharks, billfishes, manta rays(?), and other fishes that have retes (that aren't at the gills) and have what's called regional endothermy are only able to stay ""warm-blooded"" in the places that their rete is.

"We do work on plasmid-borne resistance in our lab and it is important that we keep transmission in mind, as well as de novo resistance. It is incredible that pan-resistant plasmids have been found. Naturally, I find that alarming. You are right that studies have shown transmission of pathogens and resistance genes between human and animal pathogens, and pets and owners are known to be acting as reservoirs for each others' infections. Other selection pressures for AMR come about through things like biocides, through cross-resistance, so you're right to point out that it's not just antibiotic use that selects for AMR in pathogens.

"Climate scientists run a lot of different climate models (with different known and unknown strengths and weaknesses, there is quite a spread of them) with slightly different initial conditions. Some of those different conditions are with pre-Industrial levels of CO2 in the air, some with our historical CO2 levels. In almost none of the runs with pre-Industrial CO2 does a warming level like what we've seen in the last 50 years appear, and in most of the ones that include manmade CO2 levels we see various levels of warming (both less and more severe than we are actually seeing).

That's a very strong indication that our current climate change is driven by our CO2 levels, because our current climate is right in the midst of the models that take it into account, but an incredible outlier on any models that ""pretend humans didn't exist"" from a CO2 standpoint.

A variation of this is also where you get the ""in order for confidence in avoiding heating over X centigrade we have to get CO2 generation under control by Y years"". You run that catalog of models using historical CO2 data, but then extrapolate differently for future CO2 production.

It seems like the one of the many issues that underlie P-hacking is the that it's virtually impossible to publish null results.

No you're not, and again: why is it bullshit?

&gt;If labor is making profits for someone labor deserves to share in the profits

They already do: It's called wages and benefits. Profits are *what's left afterwards*.

&gt; The value of labor is irrelevant to it being taxed though.

And so too is the comparison to labor and capital. 

&gt;I don't care if they're digging ditches, serving burgers or answering phone calls, if someone pays that person for a job they shouldn't be taxed more than someone sitting on a pile of money and earning more money by moving it around accounts for a while. I don't understand where labor value comes into play about equality in taxing.

Because you brought it up, and I ask again: Why? What is the basis for your preferred taxation scheme?

&gt; If this was so simple to see how did my life fail to be an example of what it seems like you're trying to imply? As well my story isn't special, millions of people have lived lives like this.

It's simple in that not all labor is worth  [insert X value], so the post tax earnings aren't the right metric.

"&gt; Capital gains is already taxed twice.

That's just hooey. Capital gains are not taxed twice. You are taxed once on the income that you make. If you choose to invest that income and you make any return on that investment, the return *and only the return* is also taxed. You might call that return ""income"", seeing as it's money coming in that you did not have before, and taxing income makes complete sense. You are not ""double-taxed"" on your initial income, as you imply.

See:

- [Blog post succictly explainging why the ""double taxed"" thing is hooey.](http://hlinkoreport.com/2012/12/09/no-the-capital-gains-tax-is-not-taxing-the-same-income-twice/)

Incidentally, your claim that a tax on investment interactions like this would harm people in ""bad situations"" is also pretty spurious. An older claim that captial gains taxes and the like harm average americans has been rated as ""Mostly False"" by Politifact:

Paul protested for 10.5 hours on national security to keep the government out of our internet in the bedroom.  Somebody clearly looks good right now if he did nothing.  Bullshit, he stood up for something in a symbolic manner that aligns with his views and gave his views the attention an alternate candidate deserves.  Again, that is politics.

Or maybe because you only focus on one aspect of the issue? Even ignoring the practicality of such tax in the real world, the proposal will never get passed. This is similar to the GOP's repeated attempts to repeal Obamacare, despite how fruitless and hopeless it has proven to be. Sanders knows that very well. How is this different from Ted Cruz making outrageous claim to get more donations?

Secondly, I don't understand why the tax will be funding college educations. Currently the high price stems from overabundance of demand for college education. Making it cheaper will increase the demand, thus increasing the price of education. Essentially you just took money from a group of people to give to another group of people, when neither of them really need it.

I don't for a second believe this will have an impact on who will sponsor FIFA or the bottom line of these companies; I do believe that these images are providing enough oxygen to light a fire up the ass of sponsors to do more than just ""express concern"".

Coca Cola's FB has 90 million followers and they've yanked their wall. I can assure you that corporate is very aware that their brand, rightly or wrongly, is being associated with abuses that I am sure they do not condone.

Given Blatter will never left a pinkie on his own volition, I think this has been a very clever, and possibly effective campaign to bring the behaviour to light.

I'm not referring to you, but I noticed an influx of apologists on previous threads on reddit. To me it demonstrated that a lot of people have no comprehension of the extent of abuses that have already occurred, nor an understanding of the capacity of Qatar to provide better conditions.

Kidnapping, assault, possession of illegal weapons, etc. Granted, by the law, this doesn't justify Jacket storming in and going on a killing spree, but by our society's strange love-hate relationship with vigilantes, it justified it. Oh and also HM is partially a satirical (partial-)re-creation of a late 80's/early 90's action film, so it follows the trappings of said films; ends justify the means type actions from the protag, violence *is* the answer, etc.

Hotline Miami tries to fuck with the player by asking if they like hurting people and then setting up the game to get the player to answer ""Yes. I do like hurting people.""

And, again, the settings and plots of HM are disconnected from reality.

Hatred, in this video, literally opens with the main character throwing a grenade into a crowd attending a political rally (by TB's choice, but still).

"He begins shooting before the enemy comes around the corner. Likely an aimbot or other form of cheating.

Edit: My mistake the second enemy was standing in front of the wall not coming out from it. However the last kill as a almost 160 degree turn, was highly improbable.

Less likely to be cheating but still highly probable.

Edit 2: compare to pro level gameplay. https://youtu.be/qGtVXIfoAO4

Edit 3: for those still not understanding which shot in particular is the most potentially damning of cheating. Its the one tap jump shot. The reason being the probability cone of a jump shot at that range is massive, and so highly improbable, that it is more likely he has an assistant removing the inherent spread of that gun while jumping.

[Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/z2OtSNpczsw) Pay particular attention to the jumping shots.

I'm not sure why so many people are so upset at the possibility of a cheater. If he did cheat, then its a problem, however if the player didn't cheat, then it's an overwhelming compliment.

Instead of thinking about area under a curve, think about the difference (in y-value) between the endpoints of a curve on some interval, taking limits where necessary.

The difference between the endpoints of a tangent line gives an approximation of change in function value over that interval, and summing these gives the difference between the endpoints of the function. The integral makes the approximation exact.

"I have to disagree. I ovesimplified, but this knolwedge came from certified doctors, working in the field.

Body has 3 energy storages:

 - ATP, which is able to deliver energy for few seconds of intense activity;
 - Glycogen, polisacharyde (analogue of starch), that serves as mid-level energy source trough glycose
 - Adipose tissue, or fat, for long-term energy storage.

They're being used in that order. Glycogen used by muscles lasts for 15-25 minutes of medium intensity activity, some is usually in the liver, when it runs out body does switch to breaking up lipids. 45 minutes makes sure it does happen. Afterwards, until you doesn't sit in one place, but at least walk or move afterwards, you're still being powered by fat, until you let glycogen reserves rebuild.

Next: 1200 kcal is lower PRACTICAL limit, because if you maintain any activity at all, body is on the edge of balancing between using up proteins and lipids. Anything less over extended period of time does more damage than good - both physically (you're little starving which is not that bad, but mostly you're far less likely to ingest enough nutrients, microelements and vitamins than needed), and psychically, since amount of food lowers drastically to reach 1000 or even 600 calories per day. It is deemed not healthy not without a reason. It is possible to live long (and prosper) only on body fat with flat 0 calories intake for extended periods of time (for a year - [it has been done](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/nsgli/til_that_for_a_scientific_study_an_obese_man_went)), but only with proper care and electrolytes/vitamin intake. 

And last point - carbonated drinks tends to be VERY sweet, like 2kg of sugar dissolved in 1 liter of water + flavours. Read: cola/pepsi/sodas/whatever. Carbonated wated could be fine, but not other drinks. I could have phrased it a little bit differently. BUT if one ends with with sleeve resection or any other stomach-volume decreasing procedure, ANYTHING carbonated is absolutely out of the question.

About Ghrelin - wasn't sure of the name, english is not my primary language. It is often described as 'hunger hormone', but hunger is much more complicated, it's only one of the factors. But in fact, when doing sleeve resection, ghrelin glands (correct term?) are being cut out, and that does make a difference. More ghrelin also means stronger feeling of hunger, and it does have psychological effect. As I said, most of this 'stuff' and mechanisms actually take place IN YOUR HEAD.

"Here's a copy of the email sent to all student by UNO if anyone is interested. 

Dear students, 

At approximately 9:50 a.m. this morning, an incident occurred in the Criss Library where a student allegedly pulled a pocket knife on another student. 

Reports indicate that the student who pulled the knife was asked to not talk so loudly on his cell phone.

After the student allegedly showed the knife, three students quickly subdued him. The students held him him place, away from the knife, until UNO security appeared on the scene and took control of the situation. OPD was immediately called and is now taking the lead on the investigation.

Counseling was immediately called to the library to serve as a resource to all parties involved, including the students who subdued the student with knife as well as any students in the area.

No students were injured during this incident and the library is open and secure.  ",false,false,t1_cr0pep8,TbagtheDbag,,0,1430948230,t5_2qh0u,t3_35314n,t3_35314n,899,1432812142,0,0,cr0pep8,pics,899,,

Also did your other daughter commit suicide
&gt;I lost my teenage daughter five years ago to suicide. she hung herself. I spend a lot of time telling my story in schools, etc. i'm also a board member for the American foundation for suicide prevention. Those of us survivors who go around talking about the experience accept this question as standard, and most of us just include it in our opening. I'm sure the speaker was less uncomfortable with the question perhaps many in the group were.

"Anecdotally speaking, every gay guy I know is good friends with a bunch of women. Straight women tend to be more open in their friendships with gay guys, and in my experience the result of that is that gay guys frequently have a more genuine understanding of what women like. Obviously this can't be true for all gay guys, but it's true for the ones that I've been friends with who have helped me with women.

Theoretically you should be able to get this same sort of insight from straight women who are your friends, but in my experience their advice/help tends to be skewed by what they *want* guys to think they think. As a result I generally don't go to straight women for help with straight women. Gay guys (again, in my experience, I really don't want to generalize based on a few anecdotes) don't seem to pass their advice through that filter, so you get more honest--and generally more effective--advice.

"Some of the aspects of Bill C-51 include Internet censorship. These tools will bypass whatever the Canadian government uses to censor ""terrorism propaganda"" from the Internet. The list below is more about showing what tools are available to circumvent censorship, keep your online privacy and to keep your online security. Intelligence agencies, corporations, and criminals are trying to watch everyone online, all, the time. **Do not live in fear of using these tools listed below!**


&gt;Please be mindful that nothing is a 100% with security and privacy. Tor has not been broken by anyone, but you can reveal yourself if you don't know what your doing and your someone like Edward Snowden. No one is going to care about you if you use Tor to bypass censorship. Some VPN protocols were compromised, these have mostly been removed from use or fixed. 

* **Tor:**

https://www.torproject.org/

* **I2P:**

I2P is the closest competitor to Tor, and is designed to be better at facilitating anonymous file sharing and anonymous websites.

* **Lantern:**

The only exception to never trust a free Proxy rule.

* **VPNs:**

There are many different VPNs that exist. They tunnel your internet connection to a country of your choice. If the Canadian government blocks anything that's not universally blocked like child porn, you can tunnel your internet to a country with more favourable laws and freedom of speech. 

Do not trust or give your money to a VPN that is based in Canada, let the VPN companies that didn't leave Canada go bankrupt for their mistake. Also make sure no logs are kept.

[**European Union Report:**](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmintdev/230/23008.htm) The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: **""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"".** The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that **“in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”**      


Here's the later report, 2009.

There is this thing called international  law.

Sound like propaganda, seeing as Jews had lived in the middle east for generations. When people make claims such as yours, I'm curious as to where the actual factual basis comes from. Like are you aware of any such actual plans or gas or camps chambers? 

&gt;since the Arabs who occupied the so called Palestinians from 1947 to 1967 never gave them any state and presently keep Palestinians in camps since 1947 when over 20 million people from ww2 are no longer refugees.


So the Palestinians are now only so called Palestinians. That seems like plain hate speech.

The reason there are camps at all is because  of Jewish militant activity - thats according to the IDF itself. Once chased out they were forbidden  to return essentially because they aren't jewish. 

What do the refugees of ww2 have to do with anything other to remind us oh how long Palestinians have been waiting for justice, and the right to return to their homes.

"Ok, so a lot of discussion going on about Male circumcision vs Female genital mutilation.

Here's my thoughts

Male circumcision

* removal of the foreskin

* Has a few benefits - argued to be cleaner, reduces chances of some STD infections, prevents some forms of cancers etc

* Has some negative effects - desensitises penis, glans loses protection of foreskin

Female genital mutilation

* ranges from a ceremonial nick of the clitoral hood, to removal of entire clitoris or even sewing shut of the vagina

* Has little to no actual benefits

* Leads to many medical complications and even death, reduces sexual pleasure and can cause extreme pain

So, those are the facts, now, what do I believe? 

* I think that it is wrong to irreversibly change a child's body before they can consent/make the decision for themselves. So I really don't think we should be mutilating the genitals of boys or girls

* Many of the argued benefits to male circumcision don't come into play until after they've become consenting adults, and the rest of the benefits are not even an issue in a world where people can shower regularly (uncircumcised penises can be easily washed) - why not wait until then, inform them of the pros and cons and then let them decide?

* Male circumcision has a low rate of complications, so I have no problem with consenting adults deciding that they want it done

* Female circumcision, however, has a whole host of problems and can result in death. I therefore think that this is an additional reason for fighting against it.

Does recognising the genital mutilation of non-consenting male babies as wrong take away from the seriousness of female genital mutilation? 

* No 

Does recognising female genital mutilation as being worse lessen the wrongness of male circumcision? 

* No - they are both wrong for the reason of consent, then FGM has an additional layer of being wrong for medical reasons

Does the fact that male circumcision has less medical complications mean that it is ok to circumcise male babies? 

* No, this is an issue of consent - tattoos have few complications, but you wouldn't let someone tattoo a baby

A lot of circumcised men say that they were glad they were circumcised, so are you complaining about nothing? 

*Good for them, but they should still have been allowed to choose circumcision and there are still plenty of men who wish that they hadn't been circumcised

And that is what I think

The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade are paid civil servants? Duly noted, I guess that proves my point. Keep in mind the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade are a group that [threw grenades into bat mitzvah celebrations in a wedding hall](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bat--mitzvah-massacre-in-israel-leaves-seven-dead-663843.html), and they were obviously being [included in the security apparatus](http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121823171815906.html). But Fatah said they were part of their movement.

&gt;Yes, he means because Israel kicked out Barak and elected a government that opposed peace talks (because Israelis want a two-state solution, like they proved again by re-electing Netanyahu)

You not only lied about the quote, you now point to Israel as the reason for the breakdown. Except that's not what actually happened. As Clinton wrote in his autobiography, *My Life*:

&gt;In February 2001, Ariel Sharon would be elected prime minister in a landslide. **The Israelis had decided that if Arafat wouldn’t take my offer he wouldn’t take anything, and that if they had no partner for peace, it was better to be led by the most aggressive, intransigent leader available.** Sharon would take a hard line toward Arafat and would be supported in doing so by Ehud Barak and the United States. **Nearly a year after I left office, Arafat said he was ready to negotiate on the basis of the parameters I had presented. Apparently, Arafat had thought the time to decide, five minutes to midnight, had finally come. His watch had been broken a long time.**

And also:

&gt;**I was calling other Arab leaders daily to urge them to pressure Arafat to say yes. They were all impressed with Israel’s acceptance and told me they believed Arafat should take the deal.** I have no way of knowing what they told him, though the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar, later told me he and Crown Prince Abdullah had the distinct impression Arafat was going to accept the parameters. **On the twenty-ninth, Dennis Ross met with Abu Ala, whom we all respected, to make sure Arafat understood the consequences of rejection. I would be gone. Ross would be gone. Barak would lose the upcoming election to Sharon.** Bush wouldn’t want to jump in after I had invested so much and failed. **I still didn’t believe Arafat would make such a colossal mistake.**

Interestingly, Survation are now saying that they decided not to publish their final poll because it found a big Tory lead that was way out of line with what any of the other polls had seen.  So maybe part of the problem is herding - the pollsters tweaked their methodology or held back polls to ensure that their results were in line with the other companies, reducing the risk that any particular pollster would become a laughing stock, but increasing the risk that they would all be wrong.

However, all of the major parties seemed to be genuinely surprised by the scale of SNP and Tory gains and Lib Dem and Labour losses, which suggests that their internal polls and canvassing were in line with the public polls.",false,false,t1_cr2kwpc,f4fa,,0,1431097354,t5_2qh13,t3_35a342,t1_cr2i06n,29,1432844394,0,0,cr2kwpc,worldnews,29,,

no that's not a ""human rights"" group, that's a far-left **anti-israel** group. Their founder / ""chief investigator"" was Eran Efrati who currently works full time for the BDS movement.

They did the exact same thing the last Gaza war: collected a shitload of horrifying war crime stories from Israelis who ranged from anti-occupation to plain anti-israel. **all these stories had no dates, no location, no names**... allegedly to ""protect the sources"". when the army actually followed up and interviewed the sources, in every case it was hearsay, rumors or just made up.

As it says in the article, if these guys are seeing war crimes they can report them to the army and to the regular press. when they (anonymously) report to a political NGO involved in BDS, that's not to be taken seriously.

The story is spinned in the news as a minority being percecuted but it's more complex than that. It's an ethic conflict between two groups with terrible things from both side. The divide began in WWII when the Rohingya brought by the british killed 20000 Rakhine. Since then, they have been periodic attempt at some sort of separatist movement, with ties with groups in Pakistan. 

Mobs from both side did terrible thing. Here is a video of the Rohingya rioting and setting houses on fire:

The Rakhine did the same thing.

The Burmese govermnent did a report which is surprisingly neutral. The government might have a bias in the story (maybe with the Rakhine) but the report is quite decent and details the crimes on both side as of 2013.

"No, I understand they have similarities. And different cultural practices managing to convince their own that mutilating genitals is somehow a good idea is not new...its traditionally accepted. And too be clear: all genital mutilation of unconsenting persons should definitely be abolished.

But I'm uncertain that circumcision of males was practiced with an aim to reduce masturbation. That may be so historically, but I believe today it is practiced within the context of hygiene, since we have long since moved past our fixation on male masturbation. The only sure way one could hope to eliminate masturbation in males would be to actually cut off the whole penis I think....ouch.

And cutting off a females clitoris is just like cutting off a males penis....during gestation in the womb the clitoris grows into the penis. So one is just the smaller version of the other. 

So while they can be grouped together broadly as being cultural practices justified in the name of religion the similarities end there.

"Jewish women are *allowed* to study, they just aren't *obligated* like Jewish men. 

In Judaism, women are considered more spiritual and so don't have to perform any of the ""physical"" commandments, e.g. covering the head, or wearing a tallis (prayer shawl). Study is included in this.

Judaism tends to (attempt to) treat men and women as kind of ""different but equal"". For example, men go out and earn a living and pray and study, while women make a home and look after the kids. They are both instructed to do things to lead a good, Jewish life, it's just that those things tend to differ based on your gender.

Don't get me wrong, this is an exceptionally archaic point of view. The vast, *vast* majority of Jews these days don't keep to these strict gender roles. But don't forget that it was only in the last century or two that women were allowed to vote, work, go to war, wear trousers, etc.

But if (when) Palestinian militants attack Israel, the Israelis will just occupy them again - and who could blame them?

If the Israelis gave a rat's ass about international opinion, they would probably do this, wait to be attacked, and then go back to occupying.

The problem is that doing this gives the Palestinian militants a chance to re-arm and strategize, so if (when) they do attack, it will cause more Israeli casualties than it otherwise would have.

So what would the Israelis gain by sacrificing the lives and property of their citizens?

Improved world opinion doesn't seem to have much tangible benefit for Israel, and, more importantly, it wouldn't come, anyway.

"&gt;that make Western society worthwhile in the first place

It is a matter of debate as to whether individual freedom makes Western society worthwhile in the first place.  Ironically, East Asia (Korea and Japan in particular) are highly collectivist and equally if not more worthwhile places to live.  No, the aspect that uniformly makes places better is a population which has the cognitive capacity to conduct basic research and then use it for technological advancements.  The form of government and the formal rules of the society are secondary.  Controlling what kind of population lives in your society is therefore *key* to this sort of thing.  There is also the fact that unlimited international free trade is an absolutely terrible idea, dealing another blow to the individual freedom canard.

It is also important to note that by ""diversity"", this mostly means mestizos and blacks if you live in the US, and it means south Asians, North Africans, and sub-Saharan Africans if you live in Europe.  All of these sub-demographics have greater adherence to group norms than the people who live in the west.  They also have less cognitive capacity than the white natives of the relevant countries.  In my opinion, these countries should draw a line with the ""individual freedom"" canard and halt migration from low quality people immediately.

Question:  If I wanted to break off into a state that curtailed individual rights by closing the borders to low quality people (low IQs, higher violence, religious extremism, high probability of resentment towards native population, little capacity to generate high amounts of capital value or quality research), would you let me be free from your fail?  Probably not.  According to your noble goals, everybody in the west is supposed to cede political power in votes *indefinitely* from low value-added non-white migrants, all whilst the homelands of these migrants remain homogeneous.

"A medallion is a permit from the city to operate a taxi (a taxi is a for-hire car that can pick people up on the street, as opposed to a livery car which must be dispatched from a base). Medallion schemes are used to control the number of taxis on the streets, and to regulate the taxis themselves.

Taxis are always on the street (never parked), always moving in random patterns (they don't follow marked routes or rush-hour patterns), prone to making sudden stops (to pick up street hails) and double-parking (to drop off street hails) and they are aggressive because of the constant need to find fares. This unique nature of taxis can cause significant traffic-management problems if their numbers are left unchecked.

In addition to limiting the number of taxis, medallions come with stringent regulations for the car and its driver. Everything from the paint color to the equipment inside the cab to the fares charged to the insurance and license requirements are strictly controlled.

The medallion itself is a small metal disc that is permanently attached to the hood of the car where a potential passenger can easily see it. The idea is if you're hailing a cab and you see the medallion, you will know that the cab is legal and you will get a certain level of service.

"What?? Our food system is a barely functioning. We use up an incredibly amount of resources to be able to feed most of the people most of the time. Right now livestock represents about twice as much biomass on this planet as humans, and the largest single use of land on the planet is feeding those animals.

"Lawyer here. I am really getting tired of the kind of misinformation this article spreads. I know it's easy to read an inflammatory headline and think ""Gee, I'm being screwed again!"" But that is NOT the case here. The hive mind has this whole issue COMPLETELY wrong. 

For the zillionth time, there are NO SECRET TRADE LAWS. The NEGOTIATIONS are kept secret, since it's really hard to make the compromises necessary for a massive international trade deal when every back and forth gets picked apart by the mass media and an easily swayed public. You know what happens then? You get gridlock, because no one wants to comprise when it's going to end up on the nightly news. See e.g. Congress. 

These things take weeks and months of careful drafting and back-and-forth negotiation to come into final form. And once they do, they of course are then publicly submitted to Congress for debate and an eventual vote. There is nothing ""secret"" about the laws that are actually voted on. The text isn't kept secret until the moment it becomes law. It just doesn't work that way. 

It's the same as how the nitty gritty compromise of large, bi-partisan legislative initiatives (back when such things actually happened) is done mostly behind closed doors. When you need people to compromise, particular people in the public eye, airing their every give and take is a terrible idea.

The thing ""leaked"" here was a draft. When negotiations are done and the draft becomes finalized, it will be sent to Congress and become fully public while it's being debated and eventually voted on.

No one is actually talking about getting laws passed to define what should be considered private and what should be considered public. 

Saying ""surveillance state"" doesn't really help. The issue isn't really so dire as that and using such terms makes it impossible for reasonable discourse. And that's the sort of thing that the Snowden leaks have actually accomplished. It is necessary to gather intelligence, and that involves getting information. The only question is where we draw the line on which data is to be considered private. Some people will shout ""surveillance state"" as long as the NSA exists in any form.

A hacker who has penetrated the network could then exploit this information by attempting to log into each and every IP address on the WAN using the name and password which was revealed on TV.

And it's not just Maxwell magic, R9 290 and 290X are still in good shape, 290 maybe slightly below 970 and 290X slightly below 980 (except Project Cars, but that's another story).

And stop being so righteous man, other cultures are different than yours. Get that through your head -- you won't like it, but lots of people are racist. Its a western, US-centric culture that is so anti racist, and it is because the US a huge melting pot, like you're saying. People gotta find a way to get along, right? That's how 300million people on the continental US do it. Great. Its a CULTURAL LENS that you are looking through.

And just so we're clear, I'd love to see the Christian Right's answer to Dawkins in the form of someone who was well researched and well spoken (not some talking head, talk show host who likes to yell over people they disagree with).

Yes, you did make a joke, but it is still a low effort post to put someone else down and doesnt actually contribute anything of value to the discussion other than the jerk off on the 'XD' hate. All I did was ask if a guy actually went to Cairo then act as official tourist guide of Egypt because it really is a beautiful country and I legitimately still do highly recommend that shit. He might have just used Cairo on the off joke, but this thread started in part because I was mentioning my trip to Japan, another really interesting country to go to with one of the most unique cultures in the world.

&gt;and the 34 people who downvoted you originally.

Ha, downvotes and upvotes are irrelevant. I have a 167k karma. I could shit post for days and at most, bring it down to 140k and probably banned from several subreddits which would only make it more difficult to drop karma. Completely relying on karma to gauge how good posts are is possibly the worst way to reddit. Because then all you can do is the standard in joke and circle jerk and posting a ""I get that reference"" gif every couple seconds.

Will I get downvoted for this? Almost certainly, the circle jerk has started and once it starts its difficult to turn the tide. Ive been on reddit for a long while and I can say with 95% certainty this will be downvoted. But that is irrelevant since I dont base myself at the mercy of the upvote downvote system. If I get -100 for this, so be it, 10 minutes on a default subreddit and I anyone can get that back and then 10 times more.

[Look at this shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2lritk/monster_energy_drinks_are_the_work_of_satan/clxit7q?context=3) Its nigh impossible for downvotes alone to counter act the overall upvotes gained to this low effort post from 2 years ago. Just because I dont always bend over for the karma system doesnt mean the downvotes are correct. Ive been a redditor for 3 years and I lurked for a couple months before that.

"&gt; You clearly compared their point of living without animal products to living without people groups or fundamental rights... not exactly on the same level.

 You're right, they aren't. Still doesn't make it a straw-man. The whole reason I used those examples was because it's one sure fire way of ensuring someone *wouldn't argue that living without those things is acceptable*. I'll use a more cogent comparison;

 You can live without the internet, it's perfectly survivable. That's not a good reason or excuse for having it *taken away from you*, or it being *demonized*. 

 Which is a pretty damn perfect rebuttal to the point. 

&gt; above is an appeal to emotion

 Fuck sake. No it isn't. The reason you can't murder a child is not because it's a *sentient being*, but because there are rights afforded specifically **TO CHILDREN**. In some cases, that's literally what the law states. Children. It's in the very nature of what makes a child a child that lies the argument as to why it's wrong to kill one. Not it's sentience. 
 
 There is absolutely no appeal to emotion there.

&gt; Below is a fallacy fallacy

 No it isn't. I didn't just respond with the name of the fallacy, I explained entirely why the strawman fallacy makes the argument terrible. The poster didn't take an existing argument against murder to apply to pigs, he/she **invented one themselves**.

 The intention was to demonstrate that the reasoning against killing kids also applies to pigs, but it's **THEIR REASONING AGAINST KILLING KIDS, NOBODY ELSES**.

&gt; Please stop acting superior to others. The point of debate and arguing is to convince other people, not to shame them. 

 Yes, nothing about Vegan philosophy resembles superiority and shaming.

&gt; I am not a vegan nor do I agree with the points from the original post but I do believe their argument was much more appealing.

 I care so very, very little.

&gt;&gt;Cosmetic surgery is rarely available through the NHS.

&gt;&gt;For example, a clinical commissioning group (CCG) may decide that cosmetic surgery is required for health reasons (see below) in rare cases.

&gt;&gt;Due to the limited availability of cosmetic surgery on the NHS, most people who decide to have cosmetic surgery have private treatment.

This doesn't say anywhere that the government will pay for your surgery. 

&gt;There is an optional private health care sector, but it is tiny compared with the vastly larger public system that is used by most of the population. Users pay for a few procedures, such as fertility treatments (from the third attempt onwards) and non-essential cosmetic surgery, as well as most of their own dental care and a portion of prescription medication

"Alt account.

This is going to sound a bit odd, but I'm semi-famous in another country.

I'd be happy to give information to mods for verification, but I don't think that's necessary.

Anyways; yeah, I was born and raised in the U.S., but in a certain third world country my uncle is the ex-Vice President, and my great aunt is the current governess and other uncles have seats on the senate. Also - my family owns 2/3 of the land the city is built on. As in we have street names, etc. in our name.

I couldn't pass gas on the wrong side of the road without 80% of the town knowing what happened.

One time I got friendly with a girl at my university and *my grandmother* eventually heard about it. This was in a university of over 3k students in a city of over 550k+ people. Need I mention my great uncle is the Vice President of the school? Yeah. It got around to him, too.

I couldn't do anything - be seen after a respectable time, get drunk at a club, eat too much food, be seen with certain people - it was stupid. 

I would get into taxi cabs, and the drivers would already know my family/last name. I went to a city once, and a random bum asked me for money. When I denied him - he proceeded to tell me that he knew my grandparents and where they lived. Freaky shit.

The flip side? I was handed jobs and opportunities out the wazoo. I was a radio DJ, offered modeling gigs - even given an opportunity to co-host a TV show. Kinda cool, but no thanks.

There were, however, three luxuries that I wouldn't mind having now:


**1) Having all my clothes washed, pressed, and/or folded in my closet. I never lost a sock.**

**2) Waking up in the morning with breakfast ready. Once finished, I'd call the mayordoma (head maid) and she'd meet me out on the patio with coffee to have with my cigarette (stopped smoking, started vaping).**

**3) My grandparents lived on the first hole of a golf course. Every other Saturday I'd wake up with my grandfather and play golf with him. He played six days a week, and I couldn't keep up.**

Anyways. Being famous isn't all it's cracked up to be. Certainly being infamous sucks royal blue balls.

"You could be right, but I'd be willing to bet otherwise.

I argue with a lot of people like this, mainly because there needs to be some opposition to zealots, and because I clearly hate myself. There is no winning with people like this, because it's not a discussion about facts or logic, it's a discussion about emotions.

Of course this is anecdotal, but the majority of people I've argued against are White. And these people aren't actually interested in discussing racism or sexism, but rather letting people know just how invested they are in the social discussion. It's hard to explain, but the majority of SJWs aren't actually interested in the *actual issues* involving sexism and racism; they're interested in other people seeing them be upset.

That's why, whenever I hang out with my friends who are Black or Arabic, or Persian, I never feel any weird vibes or hate from them. None of them are telling my White friends they're CIS-shitlords. That's not to say I haven't dealt with prejudice and racism from other People of Color(and other White people) throughout life, but I think a large percentage of people of all sex and color realize that SJW-thinking is stupid and leaves out the context of life in general.

I've had legitimate discussions about racial tension with them, and of course things like that exist, but it's not as simple as ""All White people suck"". It's a complex issue and anyone who can think right realizes that, but Tumblr-based thinking(SJWs) seem to think **only they** are capable of being learned. It's really the 18-22 year old White people who just went off to collage, and are realizing that the world isn't all wonderful like their cul-de-sac McMansion provided, and that **racism actually exists in the world**.

And what do SJWs do? They post about it on Tumblr, or Facebook, or Twitter; they create *awesome* memes about inequality within video games and venture capitalism in Silicon Valley(not that these aren't issues) while having no basic understanding on the topics at hand, and while disregarding things within the discussions of racism, sexism, systematic racism that are much bigger and profound.

The same people I argue with are the same people who've never read a book on racism or sexism, have never watched or attended a seminar or event on the topics, have never watched videos that don't go beyond their own confirmation bias. But if you're White and a male....Jesus have mercy on you, because your opinion does not, and will not matter and you're literally incapable of ever being as educated or empathetic to the situations of others.

And that's good to these people. Your opinion shouldn't matter, because you're White, and male. And if you're Christian, then you're fucked even more. I'm not religious, but that doesn't mean your opinion should matter less if you are, especially on social topics. 

To suggest that someone should ""just hush up"", or that one is inherently ignorant and deserving of a lesser opinion is the definition of bigotry/racism/sexism/prejudice, and it's the entire SJW-movements platform.

"He's brewing coffee using techniques traditionally used to make [Turkish Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee) (also called [Insert name of country which was formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire or the word Arabic]).

Filling each of those vessels (called a cezve) partway is water, very finely ground coffee, and possibly sugar. Because this is happening in Jordan there might also be a little cardamon in there and/or no sugar.

*Normally* to make proper Turkish coffee you heat it to a point where it just begins to bubble, but under a rolling boil, so it begins to foam up into the neck of the cezve before reducing the heat and allowing the foam to die, repeating the process 3 or 4 times before the mixture is poured into small cups (fincan) and you're left with a wonderfully strong, thick coffee with suspended grounds which quickly settle to the bottom. Sand over a flame traditionally used in the process as a sort of ""adjustable double boiler"" cups left on the surface stay warm and the heat used for brewing can be adjusted by the depth of the cezve in the sand without having to worry about the temperature of the heat source itself.

The guy in this video seems to be modifying a lot of the steps to make something like a ""regular strength"" coffee more theatrically using traditional equipment (e.g.  he starts with much less ground coffee in the pot, judging from the color to begin with,  overfilling it, not taking time to let the foam die down but pouring out some the brewing coffee into a cup to reduce the level, and pouring the results of a cezve made for several cups into a normal sized coffee cup instead).

"You want union horror stories? In some unions, part time workers are treated like shit from the full time vested workers. 

 My experience:

1. They would sabotage the buses so the part time worker couldn't pull out of the yard on time, then they'd take the route, and double/triple pay. 

2. My class there were 10 of us. Our final drive test (three students to a bus) is on the road, not in the yard or obstacle course. Near the end of the test, we head back to the yard. You have to make a left into the yard. To the right is an overflow employee parking lot. There's a crosswalk there, but no light. CDL driving rule, if someone steps into the crosswalk, even with one foot, you have to stop and let them cross, EVEN IF THE PEDESTRIAN WAVES YOU ON. The pedestrian either has to step back off the sidewalk, or continue their cross. So, the full time drivers would set the newbies up, step off the curb, wave the driver through. Then, at final scoring, that driver would fail the entire course, because that one mistake is an instant fail. One of my three partners failed (we weren't allowed to say anything during the test to our classmates, only the instructor could). Four others fell for it too. So our class went from 10 to 5, just like that. 

3. There was a board with route cards. The full time drivers would sabotage that, by moving them around, or throwing them away. 

4. There was a scandal that the full-timers were bribing the route scheduler for better routes, to not post them for everyone, to hand deliver them to the FT drivers instead. 

5. We had a thing called ""the pick"". The Pick was based on seniority, but two levels, FT and PT, even if someone was hired directly into FT compared to a PT person who'd been there a year. The pick gave you a number in the order of picking routes. First pick got the best choices. Pick dates would be posted. The post disappeared time and time again. If you missed your pick date, you didn't drive. 

6. Nepotism was rampant in our union.

"I'm someone who doesn't drink and also doesn't like to DD for my drunk friends.  My best advice is to find ""activity friends,"" people to socialize with through the things you do together.  It's the same way you'll end up meeting people much of the time, but the trick is to pick activities that you can do with someone over and over again.

For me, rock climbing and gaming are two hobbies that I've built some of my social network around - I'll meet people through these activities and get to know them, and eventually we'll start hanging out in other contexts.  Also, you can figure out what threshold of people and alcohol consumption you don't mind being around.  For me, I don't mind being around 4 or 5 of my friends who are drinking, but I get annoyed very quickly at large gatherings.  It took some time for my friends to realize I wasn't going to drink with them, but they're used to it now and rarely try to pressure me to drink.

I guess what I'm saying is that alcohol is a common interest a lot of people share, but there's no reason that you can't do the same with other interests.

"As someone who grew up in a post-communist country and had his life affected a lot by it, I want to tackle some of your ""myths"". Before I get into it I have to adress that it is also dependant on the country you and I lived in and it is somewhat subjective too. Oh and don't think of this as an attack, just here to say my experiences

Myth 1: You say it wasn't as bad because 90% of people there were criminals. What about the other 10%?!!! There were A LOT of political imprisoment, you can't deny it. The real myth here is the count of these ""labour camps"". Outside of Soviet Union they were pretty much non-existent. Instead they filled normal prisons with political prisoners.

Myth 2: I call bullshit on you. Yes, there was some acces to western culture but it was limited. This is especially true with books, which were basically smuggled into the country. And almost other books wwere basically propaganda. So yeah your culture access comment is right, BUT freedom of travel? Yeah no. If there was freedom of travel, everyone would left the country. It was extremelly strict and you could barely ever get out of your country. My great grandpa had a part of his family in Austria. He was only able to visit them once every 2 years for a limited time period and he was under surveillance. It is true my mother did go to France for a week, because she was studying french in the uni. But that was in the 80s when the Soviet pressure diminished. And even then she was being watched (no kidding here) throught the whole time there. And if you dared to stay there or travel further west? Well good luck to whoever you left behind, because you just made their life a whole lot shittier. Ofcourse it is true even western world wasn't as open, but it wasn't forbidden to travel.

Myth 3: True, wages warried. And generally the differences weren't as large as today. However I kind of disagree with the spending comment. It is absolutely true that there was just a lot less stuff and variety of things to buy.

Myth 4: You are right, but not quite. Collectivization was a thing and it was shitty as fuck and made people's lives worse.

Myth 5: This totally depends on country and social status of said person. By social status I mean if they were part of the communist party or not. The benefits were huge and colaboration just was a thing. Also the age of death of your grandparetns has nothing to do wheter they were happy or not. Average age expectancy is getting higher. Also unhappiness is a subjective thing. If you didn't mind a monotone and almost mindless life, then yes you weren't unhappy. If you want more from your life then now is your time. Also if it was so great why did so many people tried and did escape. The emigration levels were insane.

Myth 6: There is always need for technological advancement and while the difference wasn't huge in the 50s and 60s, during late 80s the gap widened a lot and when communism fell, the difference was very noticible. Hell, it is still noticable.

Myth 7: You are right there was development (eg.: fall of stalinism), but not always for the best. It varied rapidly as everywhere else. Also central economy is a horrible thing and didn't work. The insane ammount of state debt speaks for itself.

Myth 8: Wrong on your side. If you could criticize the system, why no freedom of speach, why almost no freedom of assembly, why a list of forbidden literature, why all the political prisoners, why all the writers in exile, why were people denied education because they were against the regime, why the censorship? Yes there were tendecies to  eliminate this, but as you probably know they were oppressed by Soviets (1968 in Czechoslovakia).

Your post looks at this problem from a different side and I respect your opinion, but we should look at things from both sides.

And your reasoning for the fall? Honestly I find it ridiculous. Yes American propaganda had an impact, but it is incorrect to assume it was the sole reason. The true reason was Soviet Union itself. As you know in the 80s it's economy was stagnating and it was getting worse. At the end of 80s it just couldn't afford to control it's satellites and as well as before and so the oppression against people fell rapidly, once people realize the shit they are living in, they wanted change. And because Russia was at the bottom, they got it and the wave of revolutions in the eastern block happened and that was the end.

"Well the third Saturday of every month there was a mandatory ""X-Rated Sermon"" in which the leader would ramble endlessly about how he thought STDs, genetics, and gay sex worked. One highlight was when he said gay men liked to insert lightbulbs into their anus because they got off on the risk it could break. 

He also believed Lucifer was God's ex-wife who created dinosaurs as sex toys, which is why God wiped them out. 

He believed the reason men released multiple sperm was so the sperm could travel throughout the woman's body so the man could astrally sense them to be able to hear, see, and influence what she was doing. That is why women could only have one husband. Multiple men's sperm would compete for dominance and drive the woman crazy. This was why none of the women who worked in his office could be married, he was paranoid that their husbands would try to learn ways to steal his congregation through their bodies. 

He claimed to be Jewish and Native American and excommunicated his brother for admitting they weren't. He then tried to replace his brother (who was an essential part of many of his prophecies) with a man of the same name claiming Satan had soul-swapped them to try and turn people against him.

"1.) **That the Bible promotes rape, torture and random violence.**
I get so sick of constantly arguing context with neckbeards about self-evident dispensational categorization of the Bible held throughout historical Christianity. If these people read the newspaper like they read the Bible, they'd think any abominable act mentioned in the paper constitutes an automatic endorsement of said behaviour. My suspicion is that people don't *want* to hear about proper hermeneutics because it would then destroy the ignorant and lazy generalizations they find so convenient.

There is a perfectly reasonable standard by which one can measure whether or not an individual's standards are on par with true Christian behaviour; the Bible. If your Christianity is outside the Bible, it's not Christianity. You can be a mass-murder trying to twist the Bible to justify your atrocities, or you can be a super-nice person who wants to legitimize other religions and walks of life contrary to Biblical teaching; both are equally as un-Christian. Christianity = Bible.

3.) **The Bible contains contradictions**
To me, this is the most arrogant position. Do you *really* think that multiple generations of monks hand-copying the scriptures over 2000 years and dedicating their entire lives to study and memorization missed some critical error you found in a quick Google search? The Bible is a complex book and it's passages go beyond an initial surface skim. I have not ever been faced with an apparent contradiction that is not unresolvable upon further digging (don't bother posting - I've heard them all and can't be bothered going through this again - just making a point.)

4.)**The Bible was written for political and financial gain**
Almost every one of the Bible's many authors had a terribly hard life and died violently. Paul *began* life as a prominent, respected Jew and was beaten, stoned and killed as a result of his Biblical writings. Translators, monks and other who stood up to the corrupt churches over history were burned at the stake and worse. Hardly anything about the Bible's inception and maintaining through the ages lined the pockets of any of those who made it's current prominence possible.

"I met my bf two summers ago at work but I was planning to move in three months. One night we were at a friend's apt and we were the only two people left awake. I wanted to kiss him all night. We had been talking for hours. We laid down on the floor next to each other. I KNEW he liked me but HE knew I was leaving the state and I'm sure that stopped him from making a move. My heart was racing but I decided to say fuck it. I'm the ""cool girl"" or ""best friend"" archetype but dammit! It's my life! I'm the main fucking character! So I said:
""I'm really going to miss hanging out with you. But there's something I wanna do before I move.""

I kissed him on the cheek and I DIDNT DIE. He confessed he had been crushing on me as well and we figured things out. 

Almost 2 years later and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. We're planning to get married and if I hadn't overcome a moment of fear, I would have regretted it to this day. 


EDIT: so this got a lot more attention than I expected. Tried to answer as many questions as I could. 
For those who are asking-
Yes I did move, for 4 months. I had already accepted a job by the time we solidified our relationship. Watching him on the train platform as I pulled away was the single worst moment of my life. I thought, ""Ok where's the camera and the director cause this is too much like a movie."" 
The job sucked balls. It was horrible and it gave me severe anxiety plus not knowing ANYONE close by worsened my depression. I decided to move back home. I was scared because we had only had this long distance thing. I was afraid I would screw it up or he wouldn't like me like he had before. But, I found that we are perfect for each other. Yea we have off days, but the good days are really sweet. I'm so glad we didn't give up on each other.

"Internet speeds and hard drive space.  

At least for those who live in the US, internet providers are money grabbing scum with a monopoly on the industry.  But putting that aside, they advertise the speed in units that are not used in standard computing.  A 50**Mb**connection is actually 1/8th the speed of a 50**MB**.  While computers might measure file sizes in megabyte, gigabytes, or terabytes;  internet companies gloat about their mega**bit** speeds.

Computer manufactures do the same thing with hard drive space.  They define a gigabyte as 1,000,000,000 bytes.  Which is technically accurate because the prefix ""giga"" means one billion; therefore, one billion bytes.   But because computers work in a binary systems, the break point for prefixes isn't 1,000-- it is 1,024.   So a real gigabyte is 1,073,741,824 bytes.

"Well the Tories are Conservatives, I'm assuming you're American so they're more or less in line with the Republicans.

Labour had a socialist past - they were committed to common property until 1994 when Tony Blair changed their constitution to commit to private property. They're relatively left leaning on social issues, and their economics are left leaning as well, although decidedly on the economic right.

There are the Liberal Democrats who are a centre-sitting party. They have very liberal views on both economics and social issues, and are (in my opinion) particularly progressive. They got fucked over pretty badly in the last government in a coalition that they formed with the Conservatives, they dropped from 52 to 8 seats in this election.

There's the Greens who are largely concerned with social and environmental issues. Their social policies are very progressive and they are a socialist party.

There's UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party).

"See, I didn't have a problem with Tauriel *as a character*.  And I'm a Tolkien fanatic through and through - you should have heard me bitch about the Scouring of the Shire being left out of RotK.

Sure, she was made up out of whole cloth, but there was actually a decent reason for including her: in the book, there are literally no female characters.  None.  Given current (and totally justified) attitudes about representation of women in movies, Jackson knew he couldn't have his movies without having a female character in a central role at some point.  And Tauriel was a pretty good character, overall.  Strong, independent but willing to work with others, a captain of the guard who earned her position on her own merits, and struggling with how to handle her friend obviously developing romantic feelings for her when it seemed clear that she did not share those feelings.  Depth!  Nuance!

And then the studio *fucked it up* by insisting she be shoehorned into not just a romantic subplot, but a fucking *love triangle*.  They took a really great strong, complex female character and forced the most important part of her story to be *whose pants she wanted to get into*.

"Mine was actual crazy. As in, institutionalized (shortly after we broke up) Diagnosed bipolar, and put on meds. I think he's better now, but living with someone who has untreated bipolar depression will change your life. Every day is walking on eggshells, trying not to upset him, but eventually something would (it would usually be nothing, like he can't find the TV remote, then throw a giant fit and trash the house until he found it) Episodes are violent, completely random and unpredictable, I got hurt many times, he hurt himself many times, he would just rant and rave like a lunatic, throw things, flip over tables, generally tearing the house apart. One time he slammed his head so hard through a kitchen cabinet that he splintered the door. Another time he threatened me and our other roommate with a knife. Neither one of us honestly had much of a clue what was going on, we were so young, and it all started so suddenly. He wasn't like that when we got together (in highschool) it just started hitting him a few years later, and got bad really fast. I tried to convince him to see a therapist, or get some help, but he flat out refused, I think he knew what was going on was not normal, and was scared of being diagnosed. It was pretty hard to deal with initially because I really loved him, and couldn't understand why all of a sudden this person I had shared my entire adult life with had gone full on psycho, and I genuinely wanted to help but nothing I did made any difference. I'd be lying if I said I didn't fear for my life most days, but if I tried to leave he would make all kinds of threats, saying he would hurt me, or kill himself, or kill other people. Finally it got so bad, and I had enough so I just left, he went really crazy, and his parents realized something was wrong, and put him in a mental facility where he finally got the treatment he needed. Mental illness is no joke guys, and I had no idea how common it is for these types of mental illness to manifest in someone later in life (early twenties).

&gt; Satellite radio subscribers purchase a receiver and pay a monthly subscription fee to listen to programming. They can listen through built-in or portable receivers in automobiles; in the home and office with a portable or tabletop receiver equipped to connect the receiver to a stereo system; or on the Internet.[7]

&gt;Ground stations transmit signals to the satellites, which are orbiting over 22,000 miles above the surface of the Earth. The satellites send the signals back down to radio receivers in cars and homes. This signal contains scrambled broadcasts, along with meta data about each specific broadcast. The signals are unscrambled by the radio receiver modules, which display the broadcast information. In urban areas, ground repeaters enable signals to be available even if the satellite signal is blocked. The technology allows for nationwide broadcasting, so that, for instance US listeners can hear the same stations anywhere in the country.

"&gt;For example, too much sugar can make you feel energized temporarily, but then when you crash, you can feel tired, down, or experience low mood.

Myth. That's not how the glucose regulation system works at all. High blood sugar doesn't energize you, it just means there's more energy *available*, either for fuel for muscle cells, or for conversion to fat. Further, the insulin released to deal with high blood sugar causes your liver to absorb the excess and convert it to glycogen. When the sugar drops below equilibrium levels, you don't ""crash"", because then your pancreas then releases glucagon, which signals the liver to start converting glycogen back to glucose to bring the glucose level up. This whole cycle can take *hours*. Eating sugar does not cause a rush and crash in the short term. Any sensation of such is either psychosomatic, or the result of other nutritional issues. Unless you are diabetic, eating large amounts of sugar has no effect on your brain.",false,false,t1_cqym3if,Fenwick23,,0,1430788512,t5_2qh1i,t3_34ugol,t1_cqye8kl,54,1432775304,0,0,cqym3if,AskReddit,54,,

"Most of the conflicts of the modern era all trace back to capitalistic institutions trying to increase their wealth/power beyond what the system allowed them.

Once the concept of 'divine right' died in the early 1800s, corporations expanded to fill the global power vacuum created by the fall of autocracies. Wars stopped being about kings trying to increase their land and started being about companies trying to increase their wealth. In an extreme example, see the East India Company - a single company that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people, simply because it was willing to do anything for money. 

In a post-nationalist world (which started to develop after WWII and was solidified by the end of the cold war), global economies is the number one catalyst for any international event. The current war in Yemen, for example, wouldn't be happening at all if Yemen didn't control valuable oil fields that Saudi Arabian oil tycoons wanted to control. In a more close-to-home example, there's a reason that Al-Qaeda's number one target in 2001 was the center of America's international economic presence.

What I see, then, is one of the last great bastions of war. ""God wants me to kill that man"" ended in the 1700s. ""The king wants me to kill that man"" ended in the 1820s. ""That man was going to kill himself anyway"" ended in the 1960s. The only thing left is ""That man has oil/diamonds/other natural resources"". And if you follow where those resources go, it *always* leads back to one of about a hundred global megacorporations. While America's poor suffered in the 2007 recession, Colt was raking in billions of dollars off of Iraq and Afghanistan. 

In a less global example, see the status of the poor in Western civilization. At the hands of corporations who see them only as numbers, these people are collectively stomped under the globalized boot of corporate interests, stripping away the basic quality of living that humanity has fought for three thousand years to attain. This is only possible because the free market (like *all* competitive limited vacuums - I can elaborate on what that means if you want) has a natural trend to let a few big dogs eclipse its competition and form monopolies or oligopolies. When mono/oligopolies form, it means that an extreme amount of power (over resources, money, other people, etc.) becomes concentrated to a select few. Due to the nature of how that power came into existence, it is still the natural tendency for those people to desire more power, no matter how they can get it. A hundred years ago, this meant that the Carnegie Steel Company would hire 'police officers' to slaughter striking workers by burning down the factory they were in. Today, it meant constantly eroding the ability of those workers to act independently of their employer - usually in the form of extremely long work weeks (35+ hours, leaving little time for leisure or independent wealth-gathering) and paying them only enough for them to survive (without spending money, workers can't invest in productive means = they can't get any more money outside their job).

This is all, of course, a relatively recent development in human history. Before the American Civil War it was almost unheard of for freemen to be 'chained' to any higher authority unless they were legally slaves/serfs. Even English peasants of the time were technically capable of packing their bags and moving somewhere else. That simply isn't the case anymore, and it all goes back to corporate interests 'requiring' the continual moral destruction of those who grind the wheels.

And, seeing *that* world, where *that* happens and is happening...I just can't, in my mind, justify the existence of a market that allows that. I've seen the counterarguments - ""we're living in the most peaceful time in history"", ""quality of life has been continually improving"", etc. etc. etc. But I don't see that in real life. Economic mobility in America is reaching an all time low, as the wage gab reaches an all time high. Peace is a joke, because it only takes into account wars - war is a rich man's game. But this, this economic war, this affects everyone on the bottom just as much, and it simply wouldn't happen in a controlled market or in a society where capitalistic false vacuums don't exist at all.

"Speaking of empathy, try thinking about being a doctor for once. 

Yes, people die and that's very sad. People die all the time. People are dying right now. A doctor sees it every day. Listen: Just because something is special and big to you doesn't mean the whole world is going to stop for it. From a doctor, a flat, factual deliverance is perfectly acceptable. They may be off to give the same news to some other poor family right after. They may have given that news to six families in the last 24 hours. What do you want them to do? A candlelight vigil? Hold you and cry while you cry? Lie to you? Tell you everything will be okay when they know it won't be? 

Or would you rather just be told the truth in a plain and professional manner, and be left to your privacy to cope with it? See, you're asking for sugarcoating in a place where serious and unfortunate news is a regular part of the job. The respect and empathy comes from the fact that that person did everything in their knowledge and power to help your loved one. And now that their part is over, it's time to get back to trying to save someone *else's* loved one and do the same process over and over. Doctor and medical professionals work insane hours and handle the most gruesome, disgusting shit you can possibly imagine. The only way to survive and stay sane is to be detached. What may seem cold to you is a person's way of being able to sleep for what little time they get to do so.

"Some of these were more from my school district as a whole rather than my school itself, but eh.


A lot of people died at my high school, I don't know the exact numbers, but in my freshman year alone (the first year the school was open) at least five people died. The only reason I know about these five particular students were because they were people my friends and I knew/were friends with ourselves. The first student died the night before our first semester finals, and was one of my old friends from middle school. She was battling a drug problem, inhaled some keyboard cleaner to cope with it and her family found her dead on the floor. Not even two weeks later, the two best friends of another close friend of mine died together in a car accident. Three others died within two months after winter break, mostly car accidents. The next year, I don't think there were any deaths. The year afterwards, though, there were a bunch more. The deaths at that school had a pattern where they would usually skip a year and then resume. There were rumors about a 'school curse' for a while.


Now, this one wasn't my high school, but instead my high school's rival school. There was this woodshop teacher there that everyone liked a lot. One of his students was trying to build some kind of bicycle ramp, and was having a lot of trouble with it. The teacher offered to help by taking the ramp home over the weekend to make a few adjustments. His student agreed. The weekend comes and the teacher fixes it up. He decides he should try it out, just to make sure it was really in working order. He gets on his bike and tries to ride over it- but the ramp broke, or flipped over, or something, and he ended up breaking his neck. There were no longer any shop classes offered from that point onward.


Now, something from my middle school's rival school. I didn't hear about this until I was practically in high school, but maybe that's for the better. The parents of this one student went on a trip for the weekend, leaving him alone to look after the house in their absence, assuming he'd be fine since their house was practically right across the street from the school. This kid immediately invited a few of his friends over as soon as his parents left. Someone brought drugs (I have no idea what kind) and these middle school kids had a huge, drug-filled party all weekend and lost track of time. Sunday came, and the kid's parents returned home. These kids were still heavily under the influence of drugs and believed that these 'strangers' in the house were demons, or something to that effect. So they killed them and hid them in the backyard, then went inside and kept partying. Didn't show up for school on Monday, and I think the other kid's parents were starting to get worried (I don't know if they told their parents they were going to be out all weekend, but I assume they must have if they were only getting suspicious by Monday night). They ended up getting caught and had no idea what they'd done. I don't know what happened to them, but I can probably dig up the news story somewhere if I really search. I remember that whenever most teachers heard a student talking about it they would immediately get really upset and tell them to stop.


When I was a freshman in high school, one of the teachers, an older, blonde woman, was arrested for dealing drugs from her desk and having sex with students, but that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary in high school, if Reddit is anything to go by.


When I was a sophomore, I accidentally witnessed a fight between two girls where one girl was wearing a bunch of rings and tore up the other girls face so badly she apparently needed reconstructive surgery. The girl with the rings nearly got one of her fingers torn off (I'm pretty sure it was actually degloved).

On average, men work longer hours than women, that single factor accounts for the vast majority of the 'wage gap'. Men get paid more because they work more.

Other factors like occupation choice are also important. Likewise women taking years off to care for children means they have less experience on average. (ie.

The 'wage gap' is an unsolvable 'problem' that will never go away.

"Alright we were just talking about this during dinner: differences in table manners and how my mom figured out the differences between the Dutch and the American. Like having one hand on your lap while eating. My mom does this and when she first met my grandparents (they're Dutch) they thought she was very rude doing that but didn't say anything. In the Netherlands you should keep both hands above the table. (this stems from the ye olden days where people were afraid that you'd have a knife under the table) She on the otherhand was doing what she was told to be good manners. She also switches her fork from her left to her right hand after she is done cutting and puts down the knife. This was also a big no no for my grandparents. So she is up to 2 strikes on her first visit just after eating. Later they are having tea. Well they ask her if she wants to drink something and she says coffee and they think that is very weird because its tea-time! and they offer her a cookie and then put the plate of cookies on the table. So after a while she decides to take a second cookie 'cos the plate was right in front of her. Strrrrrike 3! 
My grandparents didn't approve and my dad just thought it was hilarious and didn't explain the situation. Only after a couple of years he explaind to them that what she was doing was considered very proper in America and was showing her good manners.

"The backing of a quarter trillion dollar AA+ rated corporation.

Again, I can look somebody straight in the eye and tell them if they invest $100,000 at 55, by the time they retire at 65 they WILL have $170-190,000. And you can capture ALL the upside! Old people like security. Ya, they are giving up 2.75% to get in but they also don't have to worry about going below 7%... ever.... Also, mutual funds can not only diversify risk, but cut back on the downside. Example: S&amp;P500 gets cut in half (so does your ETF) but your mutual fund gets cut only 25%. 

I mean if you think you're smarter than a registered rep or outperform financial instruments that has some of the smartest people in the world managing them, then go ahead and go with your .25% ETFs. The most extreme example I've seen is an individual go from $80,000,000 down to $12,000,000 because they thought the same thing at you. And I've seen it about 100 times at least with people that have less than that. I've seen people spend their few hundred K retirement thinking they can ride with the market and then 2008 happens and they want distributions but can't live at nearly the quality of living as it would have been with a neat variable annuity. 

Even as someone who watches the markets daily and have done quite well for myself not only selling them but investing myself, when I start getting up there in age I'm definitely going to load up on some of these cool products.

"I knew a guy who killed an old man in the street in front of his house.

There was this corner store in the ghetto, but it was over 1 mile to walk around on public streets to get to from this back road. However, one could shorten it by 99% by simply walking through this guy's yard. This guy really loved his grass. He spent much of his free time sitting on his porch, threatening to call the cops on anyone walking through his yard, yelling, cursing, and sometimes throwing things at kids who ran through it.

My friend was a bit of an alcoholic. He cut through the yard regularly to go buy 22oz beers from the store. One day the old man was in the yard with a ho tilling a flower bed and my friend walked through without noticing the old man. When he came around the house, the old man saw him and chased him into the street with the ho. My friend was backing away, but the old man raised the ho over his head and had a massive heart attack. He dropped the ho behind him and fell face first into the asphalt, destroying his nose and pouring blood onto the asphalt around his face.

My friend stood stunned until someone called ambulance. He felt pretty bad about it.

"Salem Witch Trials

In high school history you do not learn that the reason they were acting all nutty trippy is because, well, they were technically *tripping*, in the hallucinogenic sense.

The women were harvesting rye; rye often contains a fungus caller *ergot*; it is from ergot LSD-25 is synthesized.

Amen

EDIT: As other Redditors have correctly pointed out, this is one of many theories.  I should've clarified that the theory I mentioned, while completely likely and realistic next to witchcraft and magic, is not discussed in HS at all.  I'm suspecting because kids would gobble up rye dust to try and be tripping pagans or something.  Damn alternateens

EDIT II - Ergot poisoning, which is the true basis of the theory IS NOT LSD kids.  LSD is synthesized through an extremely complex process derived from the fungus (ergotamine).  It does not synthesize in your liver to LSD.  If this was the case, rye would likely be illegal.

"The first internet café/bar opened in my college town of Guadalajara, Mexico, around '95-'96.  One late afternoon I went there, paid for an hour at a cubicle, ordered a beer (Corona) and lit a cigarette (yes, some places still allowed you to smoke inside) while the technician booted and set up the PC.

When the homepage opened (Netscape), I realized I had no idea what to do next.  Then I remembered Jaron Lanier and Timothy Leary, looked for those guys, ended up on what I think was Erowid.org, it must have been, read testimonials about acid and mushroom trips, such as a guy on shrooms at a party in Berkeley, who went into a room where people were stoned and listening to John Coltrane, and had a transcendental spiritual experience.  
Stuff like this wasn't published even on letters to magazines, I was mesmerized.

When my hour at the cubicle was running out, of course I paid for another one, after which I went back to my apartment and told my roommate about what an incredible thing the internet was.

The next time I surfed the web by myself, hand in mouse and keyboard, was until December 28, 1999!

&gt;imposed a 30-day sentence in a rape case, and said the 14-year-old victim was “as much in control of the situation” as the high school teacher who ultimately pleaded guilty. 

It is a wide spread issue, you have to think bigger think of the attitudes we have towards women for the way they dress (Look up Julian Hall), and the way we some women are brought up to rationalize the fact that they were raped. I've had this talk with some of my friends where that issue is brought up, you may think ""how do you not know you've been raped!?"" but it happens and a lot more than you'd think, the problem is internalizing ""well, I shouldn't have lead him on"" ""maybe I shouldn't have worn that"" ""maybe I did want it"" ""I just drank too much"" etc. When talking about rape culture you're not just talking about the actual act, but the acceptance of the act that it even happens in the first place, it's less about policies and more about how people think.

"Your entire life is probably 99% circumstance, luck, chance, whatever you want to call it. From the moment of your conception. Even before that if you want to get technical.

You have levels of control, but everything you desire for yoyrself is a product of your genes and upbringing. Everything you seek out.

I guess it's not a ""sad"" truth. Maybe just sobering.

"Here's some background about the Polanski case. Judge for yourself if this is qualifies as ""Rape-Rape"" as defined by Whoopi Goldberg.

He met this girl and her mother at their home on Feb. 13 1977. They were introduced by a common family friend. He claimed he was shooting photos for the French fashion magazine Vogue Hommes, and he wanted the girl to pose for him. Both the girl and her mother agreed.

Feb. 20, Polanski returns to her home and takes the girl to a secluded area where he takes topless photos of her, then returns her home. A few days later, he informs the girl that the proofs did not turn out well, so he needs to shoot more photos. Her mother wants to come along this time, but Polanski insists that having her mother present would inhibit the girl, implying that the photos would suffer and Vogue Hommes wouldn't publish them.

March 10, Polanski picks up the girl and takes her to Jacqueline Bisset's home. There are five other people there, and Polanski claims that the lighting there good isn't good enough to shoot photos. He tries to phone Jack Nicholson, whose house is five minutes away. Nicholson isn’t home, but his girlfriend Anjelica Huston is. Huston lets them use the house. Polanski and the girl go there where he serves her champagne. After a few minutes, Huston leaves.

Polanski then talks the girl into removing her clothes and takes some photos of her. She tells the grand jury she complied because she was afraid and there was no one else there. He gives her a partial quaalude, and tries to convince her to join him in the hot tub, where’s he’s waiting, nude. She lies and tells him the steam from the hot tub would give her an asthma attack. Polanski exits the hot tub, swims a lap in the pool and coaxes the girl to Nicholson’s bedroom.

There he performs oral sex on her, followed by intercourse. He stops and asks if she was on “the pill.” She said no, and Polanski replied, “Do you want me to go in through your back?” She replied “no”, but Polanski ignores her and sodomizes her as she cries. Eventually Huston returns home and Polanki stops. He dresses, drives the girl home and tells her, ""Don't tell your mother about this. It is our secret.""

A lot of people, like Whoopi Goldberg, try to claim that this was probably just some star-struck girl with an pushy stage mother, who wound up in over her head in a he-said, she-said situation. That’s so disconnected from the actual events that I can only imagine people who believe it must be willfully keeping themselves ignorant.

Polanski is an bald-faced predator. This wasn’t a heat-of-the-moment bad decision. Every action he took was a premeditated step to get himself closer to having sex with this girl:

The introduction (I can only guess that he asked his friend to introduce him to a young girl)

The magazine shoot story (which was a lie, Vogue Hommes never contracted Polanski)

The first photo shoot

The lie about the photos not turning out well

Pressuring her mother not to attend the second shoot

Leaving the first house because other people are present

The alcohol and drugs he plied her with

That’s SEVEN steps he took to prepare to rape this girl. There’s no gray area here. He’s a child predator.

It was an open secret in Hollywood that he was sleeping with Nastassja Kinski when she was 15, and nobody cared. When he was exiled to Europe, he kept at it, sleeping with 16-year-old Charlotte Lewis, and again, nobody cared.

After he fled to Europe, Polanski gave an interview to Martin Amis where he told the interviewer:

&gt;“If I had killed somebody, it wouldn’t have had so much appeal to the press, you see?” he said. “But … judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls. Everyone wants to fuck young girls!” 

In other words, *this case only came about because I can do things other people want to do, but can not. The judge, the prosecutor, the police—they all want to have sex with young girls, but they can not. I can. They see me doing something they can not do, so they feel they must punish me.*

And in closing: Fuck Harrison Ford. A lot of Hollywood figures have defended Polanski, but Ford is a special type of asshole, even among Hollywood assholes.

"As I've mentioned in all my comments on this thread, it's impossible to look at black issues without first understanding the history that lead to today.

Historically, many African American groups have tried to assimilate. One of the biggest examples is with the story of the American Mulotto Elite. Back in the 19th century (when there was still slavery in the south), there started to emerge a ""higher class"" of blacks that were a result of rape from white slave-slave-owners. Their children were ""Mulotto"" and were often given special privileges, money, and freedom by whites because they were seen as superior to dark-skinned blacks. The Mulotto elite was convinced that the best way to ameliorate the problems of blacks were to assimilate. They tended to have jobs that placed them in close proximity with whites (barbers, private drivers, ect.) and they began seeing themselves as closer to the white community, condemning all radical action for equality. When these ""Mulotto elites"" began trying to move closer to whites, the whites fled. In the 20th century they were still lynched, still denied loans for housing, still subject to the Jim Crow laws which mandated segregation. The only real positive changes for African Americans in the US have come as a result of direct action. Martin Luther King's demonstrations, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis... This rich history is inseparable from the black identity.

There is no real definition of blackness without discussing how that relates to whiteness. Whiteness is a metric of power and privilege through which ""colored"" races in the US use to define their identity (and through which they feel they are defined). When the idea of ""whiteness"" has repressed, discriminated, and murdered your people for hundreds of years, of course there's going to be an animosity towards the concept. I think intrinsically tied with this animosity is the desire to remember one's history and where one comes from. Back when I was in grade school, America was taught about as ""the great melting pot,"" where cultures and people melt or ""integrate"" into a new national identity. But that's never been the case: increasingly, academics are calling people to look at America as a ""salad bowl""-- with a diverse people who express their cultural identity in a variety of ways.",false,false,t1_cqw9f1b,FlivverKing,,0,1430593339,t5_2qh1i,t3_34jc0w,t1_cqw75x1,15,1432734289,0,0,cqw9f1b,AskReddit,15,,

"TL;DR: Our landlord called the police over $2 and a few cigarettes.

Backstory, we live in a three family home, and our landlord had agreed to rent the upstairs apartment to a couple moving from out of state without meeting them, after getting a good reference about them from the man who was hiring one of them to work for him.  They were white trash.  Loud at all hours, severely underweight and filthy dog, smoked in the house (they were told not to do this) and even jimmied the washing machine open to steal quarters (the landlord didn't collect these, the washing machine was just on our neighbor's grid, and they were used to reimburse them for the utilities that were used).  

We shared a common entryway with these garbage people, and my boyfriend left his jacket out there.  In the morning, the last few cigarettes from his pack, and two dollars were missing.  He called the landlord to let him know, (at this point our landlord was desperate to get them out, and was trying to build a case) and our landlord called the police.

"I’ve had a similar experience. It’s not a great story, because it could easily be explained as “just the cat,” but I never really *believed* that excuse, you know?

I was home from college on winter break, alone in my dad's house. It was midnight, and everything was silent. I was upstairs on the internet when I heard the kitchen door downstairs rattling. “Just the cat,” I told myself. Damn animal would sometimes rattle the doorknob when she wanted to come up from the basement. But the rattling crescendoed. The door was banging around in its frame, and the knob was rattling way harder than the cat could manage.

I crept to the upstairs window that looked down onto the driveway, trying to reason with myself. Maybe someone's car had gone off the road. Maybe they needed help. I knew that didn't make sense-- the kitchen door lead to a basement landing, not straight outside-- but it was the only thing I could think of. Before I could lift the blind and look out, I heard the voice.

It was... not a nice voice. Rough, and scratchy, but still high, like a kid of indeterminate gender. Sort of garbled, like its owner wasn't used to talking.

""Hello?"" it called out loudly. ""Hello?"" It rattled the door again.

I dropped the blind and backed away from the window. Up until this point, it still could've been the cat. Cats sometimes yowl in a surprisingly human way, y'know? But the noises went on. The voice was still weird, but the words were distinct. 

""I know you're in there!"" it said. ""Hello? Hello? Open up!""

I don't think I breathed as I tiptoed to the lightswitch. Turning the lights off now seems like the most idiotic move possible, but I'm a coward at heart. I sat in the dark and pretended, as hard as I could, that I wasn't home.

Half an hour later, after a long period of quiet, I went downstairs. I opened the door that had been rattling, and the cat shot past my legs, moving faster than I'd ever seen her. I grabbed the biggest knife from the butcher's block and made a quick sweep of the basement. Nothing. No one.

Before I sprinted back upstairs to barricade myself, I turned on the light that illuminated the driveway and looked out. We lived in the country, at the end of a long gravel drive. You simply can't approach that house without going up the driveway. But there were two inches of fresh snow lying there, untouched by a single tire track or boot print.

I slept with the butcher's knife on my nightstand and my dresser up against my door. My dad moved out of that house, soon, and I never told him what I heard that night. I know in my brain that it was probably nothing-- but all the same, I'm writing this with all the lights on and my back against the wall. Just in case.

"My best friend died in 2007 at the age of 31 from what was essentially a heart attack caused by a blood clot which had moved from her lungs to her heart. 
Her mum survives both her daughters, with the first one dying at age 11 or so from Cystic Fibrosis. 
Since her death, I had regular dreams about my friend. Some of them were just fun, others were serious. I've always found her presence in my dreams very comforting, and have never really thought much of it except to say that I am glad that I was having them.
At some point last year I had a particularly vivid dream where my friend came to me and told me that she had to go because she was 'needed elsewhere', and I actually felt her leaving. I woke up immediately and felt a great sadness at having to say goodbye to her in my dream. 
Fast forward to October last year when her mum finally told me that she has breast cancer which had been diagnosed earlier in the year.
I told her mum about my dream, and she confirms that her dreams now have both daughters in them all the time. I have only had one dream with my friend in it since she had to go to her mum full-time and it genuinely felt like a flying visit at the time. It was a happy dream.
I know without a doubt that my friend is still 'here' in this world. She believed in this sort of thing when she was alive. I don't see any reason not to doubt her in death. 
I would like to say that it is not at all terrifying or upsetting. I guess one day she will cross over, perhaps when her mum dies.

I mean liberals are a little more hypocritical but when it comes to gay marriage and such the conservatives are about as hypocritical as can be.

But in order for the gay folks to be happy and the republicans to be happy you should be able to have a ""civil union"" where if you go to the court and say you want to be together under the law then you can get a license that means the same thing(under the law) as a straight wedding but just isn't called the same.

"This is the inherent difference between Facebook and Google, also my main argument when I tell people I don't like FB but am an avid Android, Chrome, Gmail, etc. user. 

Facebook collects every little bit of information they can about you, your friends, your family, and then connects it all together. Browsing habits, shopping habits, movements, everything. They have all of this data tied together in massive databases that never get completely deleted. Once they have this massive profile on you where they likely know more about you than anyone, they sell it all to the highest bidder to be able to put more and better ads in your face.

On the other hand, Google has much better access to you, through Android, Gmail, Chrome, etc. They can track your movements, your browsing habits, and your emailing habits (to an extent). And do all of this better than Facebook. They tie all of this together into a database that DOES anonymize you, however. This information is not tied to your name or Gmail account directly. 

The major difference between the two is that Facebook makes money by selling your information, Google makes their money by analyzing the data and serving better ads to you and being able to sell ads for a higher price. Google has always made the majority of their money from ad sales. Nearly every other product they make supports this endeavor. Their products are about collecting your information to be able to serve you more relevant ads.

Facebook wants to know everything about you so that it can sell all of your information to ad makers. Google wants to know all of your information so that they can horde it and become the best ad maker.",false,false,t1_cre6skt,fatbastard79,,0,1432053073,t5_2qh1i,t3_36h58u,t1_cre3huh,15,1433150881,0,0,cre6skt,AskReddit,15,,
"I'm way too late for this, but whatever. Eight years ago I took a Boeing 747 and most of the flight was uneventful. When we reached my destination I was looking out the window and everything seemed fine. We started seeing the runway. All of the sudden the plane started shaking incontrollably and I personally saw how the wing almost hit the ground. In that moment the lights went out and a piece of luggage flew from an overhead compartment that hadn't been closed correctly. It made a very loud bang and everybody started to panick. People were screaming like crazy and you could hear every deity being called by name. This lasted less than 10 seconds and we were back in the air normally. A couple of minutes later the pilot told us in a totally calm voice that unexpected weather in our destination had lead to us circling it for another half hour. I convinced myself the pilot's calmness was proof enough that we had overreacted and was just happy to see my family after the trip. From the airport to my home most areas were blackwd out (large city, long drive, highly unusual). Trees were pulled out of the ground like it was nothing, cars were damaged, etc. This is common in tornado areas or the like, but I hadn't seen this in my city in my 20 years up to that day. Turns out the unexpected weather refers to winds that broke every single speed record for my city ever measured. There were news reports on the storm on TV next day and they explained it was completely unexpected. It just happened out of the blue in a matter of minutes and was gone just as fast. What they never mentioned is that pur plane was trying to land as this unfolded. I convinced myself that it just hadn't been that close or important. Some weeks later I'm at a party for a friend and one of his uncles mentions something about working for the airline in passing. I asked him about my flight and he was really thrilled and nervous to learn that I had been on that plane. ""You're kidding me, aren't you?"", ""That was so fucking close for you guys"". ""They're doing a whole investigation and evaluation of the whole incident"" - I was floored.

"I was dating this girl just before and after I turned 19.  She would talk all of the time about people she knew that would frequently meet new people, drive to Law Vegas, get married, bang each other all weekend, get it annulled and then come home.  Being a bunch of Mormons, we are not supposed to have sex outside of marriage, so this was some kind of justification to do it.  I always just blew it off like I thought it was stupid.

Then, one night at a dance for young single college-aged Mormons, she took me out to the parking lot, got on both knees and asked me to marry her.  I was surprised because I barely knew this chick.  We had been dating 2 or 3 weeks.  She told me she wanted to drive to Law Vegas that night (Thursday) and get married.  I laughed it off like it was a joke, but she told me she was dead serious, I did not need luggage because she would buy me new clothes when we got there, and that her bags were already packed in her car.

Then I realized that she was one of the people she knew (or the only person) who had done this before.  I said Hell No!  I still saw her for a couple of weeks, and soon after my 19th birthday, we broke up.  She told me that she would only marry, and deserved to marry, a return missionary.  I laughed my ass off because she was a whore and had specifically told me I was not good enough for her.  I dodged a crazy train there.  If you want to bang, just bang.  All the stunts don't make it OK; Mormon or not.

"Might be in too late but I have two.

First: 
back story. my mom had a friend named Joe that would always try to teach me stuff about math and computers at a very young age. he spent a lot of time with me when i was young on these concepts and one of my fondest memories of him was him passing out one night sitting on our porch in the ghetto, and a man snuck up to our house from the alley with a 2x4 and was about to swing on him. parents saw and chased the guy off just in time. the pump of a shotgun does the trick. anyways, fast forward 7 or 8 years later. we've moved to a better neighborhood, and Joe has been dead for years. One night I'm in the living room with my mom watching tv, couldn't have been 14, and decide I'm going to sleep. walk into the room and there he is. Joe is sleeping on my bed. back facing towards me. i see his white hair, the body, etc. not covered with a blanket. its plain as day. i froze and just couldn't believe it. run out of the room and tell my mom and of course when we go back there is nothing. i'll never forget that.

two:
there's a house a few blocks away from me and i was friends with the kids that lived there. they always would talk about crazy shit happening at their house. one day i go over there and they had up and left. house is condemned, and tons of stuff is still there. old motorcycles in a shed, a boat, etc. one day a couple friends and I decide to go investigate and see whats the situation there. a friend goes into the shed, we'll call him Tom, another friend goes around the back of the house, call him Jesse, the girl that came with us stays at the top of the driveway, and I go to the front door.  I walk up the steps and smell the worst smell i've ever encountered in my life come over me. to this day, ive never smelled anything so rank (im in my mid 20's now)  it startles me and i stop and look around. before i can reach up to try the handle of the door, the glass shatters in the shed Tom is in and he runs out towards me. Jesse runs from the back of the house hearing the commotion and Tom is pale as fuck saying he doesn't know how it happened.  Before we can even think all of the windows of the house start pounding. The bottom windows were boarded up and the top windows were clear with white drapes.. and something is just pounding on these windows. we take off running and the girl up the driveway is like wtf is that and starts running with us. 

YEARS later, I end up going back to the property taking a walk with my gf at the time.  It was off of a main road down a long driveway and I noticed the house and everything was demolished so it was just like a nice inlet in the forest.  We went over there and laid out in the field and shes laying on my chest.  It felt kind of eerie for me for some reason, assuming it had to do with what happened there years ago.  She tells me stop playing with her hair.. and both of my hands are behind my head laying on the ground. I kinda leaned up and suggested we go casually and told her about the entire thing later.

"My mother regularly punished me by making me hold up two phone books, one in each hand for an hour or more, if they weren't held straight up then ten minutes would be added to my time she started doing this around age six. 

If i did not clean my room or do all my chores daily, wash dishes, take out the trash and vacuum the house i had to do ten laps around our neighborhood. If i had to guess id say it was maybe a half mile each lap, she would make me get up at 5:00am to do them. She started doing this around age seven or eight.

I regularly was sent to my room for the night with out dinner, my sister would steal loafs of bread and hide them in my heater duct. happened ever scenes i can remember.

I have been locked in my room with a pad lock on the outside of the room, because when i would be sent to my room for the night the next morning i would eat a few bowls of cereal and she was REALLY strict about food.

There has been multiple times where i was not allowed to go trick or treating, there has been multiple times i didn't get a Christmas or Easters either, because i told my teacher what she was doing to me.

To be clear, i was never in any trouble at school unless trouble came my way, if i did not take care of myself when the bully's at school or in the neighborhood, i would be disciplined.

This is all 100% the truth, I'm not the only child either but i always got the worst of it. My sister wasn't as strong as me and it severely affected her around 24 years old she overdosed and i was police escorted from her funeral as soon as i arrived.

Its been five years since we spoke and i don't plan on ever reconnecting, she will never know my daughter.

For those wondering my sister and i were really close i spoke with her the night she overdosed.

Then, go to the store and buy the same size, put the new one in, chuck the old one out.

"Alright, maybe I just don't understand the term ""victim blaming"" then. I assumed there had to be blaming of the victim involved somehow, but I normally avoid these arguments, so maybe I'm confused. Here are two statements:

1. If she hadn't been drunk, she wouldn't have been raped.
2. If she hadn't been drunk, she wouldn't have been raped, so it's her fault she got raped because she was drinking.

The first is possibly true; there's no way to be sure. This *does not mean* she shouldn't be drinking -- no part of that sentence says that. It says ""If X, then Y"". It could just as easily say ""If she were named Alice, she wouldn't have been raped"" and it would be exactly the same for these purposes.

The second is patently untrue, and obvious victim-blaming. In my understanding of the term, the first is not victim-blaming, because the victim was not blamed for anything. Another example:

1. If she hadn't been swimming, she wouldn't have drowned.

If somebody were to say ""she drowned because she was swimming"", everyone's reaction would be ""...no shit"". If somebody were to say ""no, stop victim-blaming: she drowned because she drowned"", people would blink at them and then move on to more productive conversations that might actually help prevent future drownings.",false,false,t1_cqx974m,sysop073,,0,1430686636,t5_2qh1i,t3_34pqrv,t1_cqx8vis,-19,1432751390,0,0,cqx974m,AskReddit,-19,,

"This kid who started in middle school football was on the high school football team with me during freshman year. He would constantly annoy everyone on the team when he wouldn't get playing time (even though he was shit at football).

Well everything was going great when two plays pass and then the spoiled kid walked onto the field and told my friend to get out of his spot so he could play. Then the head coach on offense grabbed him by the shoulder, took him off the field and yelled at him and said ""YOU DONT GET TO JUST PLAY WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT, JUST BECAUSE YOU PAID YOUR WAY ON TO THE FIELD DOESNT MEAN YOU'RE GONNA PLAY ON THE FIELD"" and sat him out for the rest of the day.

"I used to pirate because that's how I was introduced to internet media in general be it games/movies etc. when I was a kid. Back then it was a rush to get everything. After a while I read about how things are and how much it really costs to make these things and boy the realization was huge. Still I had no money to get something fancy to eat, let alone buy a movie or a game. I narrowed down from pirating everything to only the essential things I required and I started saving up for a few very important games. Movies started becoming less interesting, I saved up for important movies and saw them in the theater itself. 

What happened was I started to realize that just because it was free through pirating doesn't mean that somethings aren't worth spending your money. Some Directors/Game developers gained a lot of respect in my eyes that I'd not eat anything extra but save up to buy their things legitimately. Now all of this was long long ago. 

Now that I have enough money to buy what I need, I just buy what interests me rather than taking over the entire ocean like before. The thing that most people don't realize is that these things just cost too much and when you're young with no other source of providence, you don't have much of an option. For me, because I did pirate I learned so much about new languages and new cultures which I would've never known otherwise. I learned more about life in general and the value of things even if they may be free. 

That's why I think that sometimes the whole piracy thing is overblown. For many there just aren't any other way to experience new media. If every form of media was available to everyone on the planet and priced accordingly so they won't have to choose between spending money for a movie ticket or a breakfast for that day, life would be a lot better.

"It's layers of abstraction.  Tech people solve a problem that is annoying or takes too much time, make a solution for it, and then that problem is solved forever for everyone and then you interact with the ""new"" interface.

So signing up for an online service.  You used to have to type the exact address in.  Then poke around the page to find some sort of registration or something.  Type in all your info.  Go to your email.  Get confirmation code. Type in confirmation code.  Fill out profile.

Now you don't even need to know the exact name of the service.  Type in an approximation, Google will know.  Go to the website and you're confronted with a registration thing almost right away.  You don't even have to provide your information.  Just click ""Sign in with Google"" or ""Sign in with Facebook"" and you're on your way.  I know that all that other stuff is happening because I had to do it all manually once upon a time.  But if you never had to do that, you might not even know that all that stuff is happening behind the scenes.  It's just how it works.

Over thousands of iterations over thousands of developers, layers of complexity are abstracted and the end user is presented with something that is as easy to use and understand as possible with absolutely no knowledge necessary of the layers and layers of complexity that make it possible for them to interact with the internet and computers they way they do.  Even many programmers don't *fully* understand how a computer works - as in, given the tools, how many programmers would be able to build a functioning computer from logic gates through RAM, machine language, assembly language, etc?

This makes the technologies very powerful.  You can do so much more without having to worry about all the steps that are happening automatically for you in the background.  This also makes a user that is much farther away from understanding how the actual technology works or what is going on behind the scenes.

But it's like that for everything eventually.  I have no clue how my microwave works.  Push Button -&gt; Get Hot Food.  ",false,false,t1_crajgnu,stareyedgirl,,0,1431732550,t5_2qh1i,t3_362o09,t1_crah3iy,19,1433087911,0,0,crajgnu,AskReddit,19,,
"It has been two years, I don't have the fucking evidence to prosecute. There isn't a .00000000001% chance. Prosecuting rape, even with incredibly strong evidence, is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. I NO LONGER HAVE EVIDENCE.

I only recently, like within the past 6 months, got to a place where I can speak about it. I tried to kill myself a lot of time, and actually succeeded and was dead for a couple minutes, because of what happened. I can't imagine what would have happened if I reported. Being harrassed by the police, subjugated to the ultimate slut-shaming fiasco of the defense, begging a jury of my peers to believe me. 

I was not the perfect rape victim. I had a lot of sex and I liked rough sex. That would have been dug up. I had a threesome, that would have been dug up. I'd had a bottle of wine that night and was a bit drunk. I would have had my whole life thrown out there for everyone to judge me when I was already at a point in my life where I wanted to die. I don't think I would have survived a trial, I think I would have killed myself.

Two out of the three people I know that prosecuted their rapist regret it. Their trauma became so prolonged, so drug out, that it's been many years since it happened and they're struggling worse than me. 

I'm done arguing this with you because I'm not going to change my stance and you're not going to change yours.

"I think part of the reason this happens is because the majority of the public is heterosexual.

But if I'm reading what you're saying correctly, then I agree. As a heterosexual male with a lot of gay and bi-sexual friends, I often think about how hard it might be for them when we go out to talk to new people and try to get numbers or dates. That is, it isn't seen as appropriate for them to hit on people of their own sex, and they've confided in me that it is hard for them that my friends and I who are heterosexual can. Most of us are in high school or freshman in college, and it's especially rare from what I can tell to find openly gay people our age, especially in school. (Also since we're underage, my gay and bi friends can't go to gay bars.) 

While I and many people still I know still accept gays and don't discriminate, it's still weird to think that we seem to naturally be more uncomfortable to be hit on by a person of our own sex rather than someone of the opposite sex, even if we're not attracted to them.

In all, I think we just have a society that is moving towards acceptance of gays, but we still don't find it natural in public. I know in my heart and mind that it's perfectly fine to be a homosexual, and that it doesn't make sense to judge them.

"Nope. In fact:

&gt; In June, 2014, an Arizona political blogger alleged that Huppenthal was the person behind pseudonyms used for several years to post anonymous comments on his blog, and other political websites.[19]

&gt; The anonymous comments referred to Huppenthal in the third-person, discussed subjects including abortion, the economy, education, child protection and race, and were overtly supportive of Huppenthal's actions and policies. Comments labeled critics as ""evil scum,"" called people who receive public assistance ""lazy pigs"", and compared the work of the founder of Planned Parenthood to the actions of the Nazis. One group of comments included a call to shut down Spanish-language media: ""We all need to stomp out balkanization. No spanish radio stations, no spanish billboards, no spanish tv stations, no spanish newspapers. This is America, speak English."" And ""I don't mind them selling Mexican food as long as the menus are mostly in English. And, I'm not being humorous or racist. A lot is at stake here.""[20][21][22] Media outlets characterized the comments as ""harsh,"" ""inflammatory,"" and ""racist screeds.""[23][24]

&gt; On June 16, 2014, Phoenix television station KPNX broke the story, claiming that not only was Huppenthal responsible for the comments, but that he had posted many of them from his office at the Arizona Department of Education.[25] Although Huppenthal did not respond to KPNX's request for comment, two days after the story ran he held a news conference, where he admitted to making the comments, and hundreds of other anonymous posts on political blogs. He defended his positions, but apologized for his ""hurtful"" comments, stating ""I sincerely regret if my comments have offended anyone.""

"As a person who works in manufacturing, this story does not surprise me. I can not tell you just how many issues we could fix if the management actually listened to us ""peons""

The info then becomes confined transfering straight from station to station so its near instant. Its becoming an issue causing some delays while I wait. I suggest we add a station directly before it. A simple box and upload sensor.  It would preload the info on its own station and allow me to work at full speed.

The suits think its to costly and time consuming to do. So they get our engineers on it to try and reduce load time and what not. 3 months later they have managed to reduce it by 2 seconds... I am still stuck waiting for 30+ seconds... we produce 300 units a night at 800 bucks a pop. At full speed we can put out about 1 unit every 2 mins or so. 30seconds a unit is alot of time.

"Opposite end of this but kinda relevant. 2 year old daughter had had a bad cough for a bit (we'd all had a cold but everyone else had gotten better). Noticed that the glands in her throat were swollen so off to the gp.

He thinks it's probably bacterial so he prescribed a course of antibiotics. Next day we noticed that her eyelids seem swollen so stop the amoxicillin and go back for different antibiotics. 

The morning of the last day of the course the daycare notices a rash and freaks out about meningitis. Back to the doctor where he takes a look and is 100% sure that it's not meningitis but asks how she's doing. My daughter's cough is mostly gone but she still has a low fever and is generally acting sick. This being Friday the doctor says that it's probably viral then, books an appointment for Tuesday to see how she is after a few more days.

On Sunday my wife WebMDs the symptoms and tells me that it came back with strep throat or leukemia and she wants to go to A&amp;E at the hospital. I kinda scoffed and said that WebMD always returns cancer, we're going to the gp on Tuesday, lets just wait till Tuesday. 

Tuesday comes, nothing has really changed with my daughter's health, gp says that it doesn't feel right, gives us a letter and sends us to the hospital. 

Hospital gets blood tests done; bit later starts a blood transfusion because she's very anemic and starts broad spectrum antibiotics. After a tense night they fly my daughter and wife via helicopter to the main child cancer hospital. 

So yeah, sometimes the self diagnosis can be right.

TL;DR Daughter gets sick, wife ""self"" diagnoses leukemia and strep throat. I scoffed. Ends up being strep throat, an ear infection, and leukemia.

"Haha, good luck with that. I'm a salesperson's worst nightmare. 

A few years ago I was looking to buy a car at Carmax. I liked the car and told the guy I'm going to go eat lunch across the street and we'll finish this when I get back. The dude comes back with ""The car might be sold by then."" Carmax is supposed to be a no-sales-bullshit car lot. I fucking blew up on him. I held one finger up into his face, told him to stop talking and get me his supervisor. He starts realizing he's fucked up and starts sputtering and I said ""GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!"" and everyone in the display room starts watching. 

The manager comes out and is trying to usher me into his office, but I wasn't having none of it. We were going to have this conversation in front of everyone. ""WHY IS YOUR EMPLOYEE TRYING TO USE HIGH PRESSURE SALES TACTICS?"" The guy is looking stricken and dry washing his hands and looks like he wants to sink into the floor. I also see the head honcho watching everything from afar.

It turned out that homeslice was new. In the end, the salescritter was sent home for the day and I got an additional $1000 off the car and they send a gift card and additional apology later. None of that was as good as the look on fucktard's face when I blew up. So worth it.

"Points... Corrections... yadda yadda yadda.

Points! It's suggested that The Great George Washington might not have gotten a cold from an early ride around Mount Vernon, rather he got that cold from leaping, pantsless, from the room of one of his servants after he'd been *ahem* serving the guys wife.

Elizabeth Tudor of Englind (Queen Eliz 1) had at least one child in secret. Upon sleep (I made this post pretty bloody late) I think this was just one of those factoids that was tossed out by one of my comunity college teachers. Probably citing the Prince Tudor theory that says Shakespear is QE1's illegit child

In ancient Rome, there was one select room in your house that was wall to wall pornography.Seriously, they found a place where all four walls have murals depiciting sexual acts, and it's been theorized that this was used to train young girls about their wifely duties (This was for upper class families).

Romans were Exhibitionists. Most every piece of Erotica has a slave watching. This carried over to their normal lives where houses were set up so you could see the man of the house doing his work from the street.

Correction:

Catherine the Great of Russia didn't hire a servant for her bedding needs, instead it was one of her ladies in waiting, a full blown countess, who'd try out possible new suitors and report back to the Tsarina herself. Also it's suggested that Catherines husband had... issues getting it up. We do know Catherine literally humped a pillow when she was coming of age because we have her diaries.

Oh, other random thing I learned from a humor website. Anne Frank's Diary? Edited up the wazoo to remove the fact that this was a young girl going ""WTF is going on down there?"" as she became a mature woman. Yeah, her dad had to read, and edit out, discussions of self exploration.

I could do an entire thing on Roman sexuality (Actually I did a 20 page paper on it to get my degree), but the last little bit I'll toss out is this. Romans didn't exactly care about your sexuality... they cared about your role in sexuality. If you were gay? Fine as long as you're the guy doing the pitching. They also said that performing oral sex was the cause of bad breath, and it was perfectly normal for the daughter of a semi-wealthy family to find herself having sex with a rich old man to help her dad pay the bills. Her mom would have to put up with other men too. It's suggested that Caesar (THE Caesar) screwed Brutus' mom, and sister(s) and as part of that he bought property for Brutus family. From Suetonius, Julius Caesar section 45

""It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women, as well as very expensive in his intrigues with them, and that he debauched many ladies of the highest quality; among whom were Posthumia, the wife of Servius Sulpicius; Lollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, the wife of Marcus Crassus; and Mucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey. For it is certain that the Curios, both father and son, and many others, made it a reproach to Pompey, ""That to gratify his ambition, he married the daughter of a man, upon whose account he had divorced his wife, after having had three children by her; and whom he used, with a deep sigh, to call AEgisthus."" But the mistress he most loved, was Servilia, the mother of Marcus Brutus. for whom he purchased. in his first consulship after the commencement of their intrigue, a pearl which cost him six millions of sesterces; and in the civil war, besides other presents, assigned to her, for a trifling consideration, some valuable farms when they were exposed to public auction. Many persons expressing their surprise at the lowness of the price, Cicero wittily remarked, ""To let you know the real value of the purchase, between ourselves, Tertia was deducted:"" for Servilia was supposed to have prostituted her daughter Tertia to Caesar""

Also, Olive Oil was an ancient contraceptive.

"Worked at a deli, one day I noticed a really crusty piece of Swiss on one of the slicers. Intrigued on what could happen, I cut another slice and put it under a scale thinking no one would look there and I could check on its decaying process every once in a while. 

One of my coworkers found it though, so I put another one when he wasn't looking. I wanted to see how gross it would get! But he kept throwing it away. I kept replacing it. He actually started going a bit crazy, he wanted to know who was putting Swiss under the scale. 

At this point, I didn't care about molding the Swiss, I just wanted to mess with my coworker, who we'll call Jim because that's what we called him. I worked there really part time, less than 15 hours a week if I could help it, so I got two of my buddies there in on it so they could replace the Swiss when I wasn't around. Always the same type of Swiss, always under the same scale. 

Jim got the managers involved, he was losing it. He wanted to know who and why. One day, after maybe two months of this, I got called into the managers office. They tried to get me to admit to it, playing it like they're just trying to get to the bottom of it. But then he said after combing the video footage, he caught me putting it there. He said because of my destruction of company property, I will be put on suspension until I called my Union. That was too much work for me so I said fuck it, shook his hand for giving me a job for a year and that was that. I also offered him 5$ to compensate for the unsold Swiss, but he said it wasn't the dollar amount that mattered.

"Blackwater (which has since changed its name to Xe and then Academi to stay under the public radar so they wouldn't get prosecuted for war crimes) is a ""private security contractor.""

But these guys aren't mall cops, they only hire people with significant military experience, and they are typically armed with military-grade weapons. They are hired for situations where shooting at people is very likely. But we must NOT call them ""mercenaries,"" oh my no. THAT would be illegal, and what's more, the Geneva Conventions make it perfectly legal to execute mercenaries if you capture them, which is not the case for regular military POWs or ""completely innocent civilian contractors.""

In the early days of the Iraq war, Dick Cheney (who was the de facto guy in charge in the first years of the Bush administration) hired a shitload of these guys and sent them to Iraq to *ostensibly* act as security for convoys' VIPs, and so forth. Although they *did* do a lot of that, the real reason was Cheney wanted people who were not accountable to the military chain of command, people who would--in his words--take the gloves off.

And they did. Blackwater quickly gained a reputation for being savage goons who would just as soon shoot you as look at you. In at least one famous case, a crowd of Iraqi civilians did not clear out of the path of the VIPs they were escorting fast enough, so they opened fire on them with automatic weapons. Nobody has a clue how many innocent people were injured or killed, because they just took off with their convoy, and they were not accountable to a chain of command, like real soldiers are. But ask yourself this: if you were the parent of a five-year-old whose head had just been turned into chunky salsa by these guys, would the fine legal distinction between ""private security contractor"" and ""mercenary thug"" mean diddly squat to you? I'll go out on a limb and guess ""no."" Among US troops, Blackwater quickly became known as ""Black Death.""

So anyway, it quickly became clear to your average Iraqi that these guys were not ""liberators,"" they were conquerors and just straight-up murderers.

In 2004, a group of Blackwater guys were protecting a convoy that was traveling through the town of Fallujah, and something happened. Nobody has a clue what CAUSED the incident (because, again, that whole ""no accountability"" thing), but the upshot of it was that four Blackwater guys were killed, their bodies were burned, and then the corpses were hung from a bridge.

This was the main trigger for the first battle of Fallujah, where some 60 US troops were killed.

So...what happened? Were these guys just peacefully going about their jobs protecting a convoy when they were attacked by ""insurgents,"" as the Bush administration claimed? Yeah, maybe. It's entirely possible. Had these specific guys done something to seriously piss off the locals? Again, entirely possible. Were the people who attacked them *actual* bad guy insurgents? Again, maybe.

And in all cases, maybe not.

You need to understand that word ""insurgents"" is a tricky one. From just about day one, the Iraq war was a *seriously* bungled affair, by the civilian government, the military, and the private contractors (in addition to Blackwater, Halliburton--which Cheney used to be CEO of--was given free reign to run roughshod over the country, and they did their part to help kill American troops as well). So even if initially, we WERE ""greeted as liberators,"" as the official line went, in very short order, average Iraqis realized that Americans weren't really any better than Saddam. Indeed, they were WORSE, because at least Saddam managed to keep the electricity and water on, which the US was never able to.

So to no surprise whatsoever, Iraqis started fighting back against the people who had invaded their country. Cheney and his goons were simply incapable of grasping that these people might have some kind of legitimate beef, so they labeled the fighters ""insurgents,"" and claimed that they were nothing more than a tiny handful of leftover ""Saddam loyalists."" This dangerous fiction was the official policy LONG after it became clear to any sane person that we were actively creating huge new masses of people who hated our guts.

So, the very bottom line here: in the end, it scarcely matters whether *these specific guys* had done anything wrong. Iraqis knew that the US--and Blackwater in particular--were not the Happy Freedom Peace Guys they were claiming, that innocent Iraqis were being arrested, tortured, and killed on a daily basis. What was done with the bodies after they were killed was fairly brutal, but as I said originally, and what has caused all the ignorant shouting here is that the killing itself was *probably* not entirely without justification.

"Obligatory not a garbage man, but... About 5 years ago, I went to the local dump to rummage through some things on my drive home from work. Most days, I don't find too much, but it's always worth a glance just to see what's arrived since I had been there last. After a few minutes of looking around, I found an antique cash register, like the kind that you only see in old movies in a general store. It was rusty, sure, but I figured I'd take my chances on seeing how much I could fix it up and resell it for. It looked like maybe it could be shined up, and I figured I could get a couple hundred for it if I was able to restore it a little bit if I sold to the right collector. There wasn't a key with it, but I figured it'd be easy enough to pick the lock to make sure I wasn't missing out on anything hidden before reselling it. I thought restoring it would make for a great summer project to do in the evenings. It was a lot heavier than I expected, but I guess most things were back then, before everyone started trying to make things as cheap as possible. After  lugging it near the exit, I had to pass the security guard, who usually looks through what everyone got. He has been working here for years, and he loves seeing people's eyes light up as they proudly show and explain to him what they're taking home with them. I started approaching the guard, and he slowly turned his head toward me and mumbled, ""I can pop that right up here and try to give a look-see inside,"" he offered, since there was no key. As I got closer, I realized that his face was green, and he looked like he was straight out of the Paleolithic era. I handed the cash register over, and he was able to open it immediately.

"The problem I have with this answer is that is is just plain wrong.  Honestly, just wrong.

As /u/offendedliver points out there are different costs of living everywhere and this directly affects the price you will find that people charge.

It also makes an HUGE assumption that all ""Indian"" developers that charge a wage that gives them an excellent quality of live are bad.  Guess what?  There are good and bad developers in every country and at all price points. 

Large companies capitalize on this.  I work for a large multi national that does IT work.  We've got low cost development centers set up all over the world.  Yes, we have them in India and other countries.  We pay a good wage and have some very good developers on staff. For customers that require (or want) onshoring development work done we have had a low cost center in the Midwest US for over a decade.  We've had it long enough that a few years ago we opened a 2nd one up in the Deep South.  I mean seriously bumblefuck US Deep South.  We can offer prices in San Fran, NYC, Boston or other major cities that make people look twice.  We beat out local competition on many RFPs because of this.  

Many of our developers started out as junior developers.  They graduated college and didn't have the experience to jump right in to the projects we had.  We had them work under more experienced developers and they grew their skill set. Are they bad developers because their cost of living is such that for $150,000 they can get land, a very nice house, and furnish it?  Nope.  The COL in their area has to do with how skilled they are.  They worked up the ranks just like everyone in our company.  They were mentored by senior developers just like every junior developer is in our company.  

The problem with outsourcing to an Indian, or other low cost developer is a problem of people not understanding project management and the scope of their project, scope creep, technologies involved, etc.  they don't have the skills to interview a developer to understand that what he/she has as a skill sets not is what they need.  They don't understand that the portfolio that this low cost developer is showing them is all customized Wordpress themes with a shopping cart added and not a fully developed solution.  

I know this thread is full of freelancers and I will probably get down voted to hell for this, but what I say is true.  The micro economies of both those in the US as well as other developing countries make a vague and simplified answer of ""you get what you pay for"" just plain wrong on many levels.  

Tl;dr the problem isn't the low cost, the problem is the consumer isn't educated enough to understand this low cost developer can't give them what they need. ",false,false,t1_crj9iow,minze,,0,1432470394,t5_2qh1m,t3_371esn,t1_crius8o,15,1433238673,0,0,crj9iow,web_design,15,,

"&gt;Ravindra Patil: The death of a messenger

&gt;This Post Was originally Written by Banerjee, Soumyadipta of http://www.bollywoodjournalist.com Original Author has removed the same http://bollywoodjournalist.com/2013/07/08/mr-salman-khan/ Here is a Reproduction under FreeSpeech.

&gt;In India, the testimony of the prime witness is considered the most important document in a criminal case, which often influences the final verdict.

&gt;In the 2002 hit-and-run case of Salman Khan, the man who found himself in the epicenter of the controversy, was the prime witness of the case — constable Ravindra Patil.

&gt;Those close to Patil admitted that he was under enormous pressure to change his statement.

&gt;There were many who wanted Patil to change his statement. They preferred that Patil maintain that Salman leaned back to listen to him seconds before he lost control of the wheel. This would mean that the accident was caused by a ‘human error’ and not because he was drunk. Some people wanted him to say that Salman was not drunk at the time of the accident.

&gt;Whatever be the case, Patil did not change his statement till the last day.

&gt;It was unclear who was putting pressure on Patil — some say they were all ‘well-wishers’ of Salman Khan from the police force while others say that those talking to Patil were Salman’s common friends from the film industry. Whoever they were, the pressure tactic seemed to be working as Patil was showing signs of a nervous break-down.

&gt;Why was Ravindra Patil so vulnerable?

&gt;Patil was a constable and hence belonged to the lowest rung in the police force. He admitted numerous times that he was under pressure and he would always try to duck the media.

&gt;During 2006, when the examination of witnesses was on, Salman had hired the best lawyers in Mumbai who were all charged up to cross-examine Patil. But then, something unexpected happened. Patil just ran away one evening. His brother lodged a missing report about Patil at a local police station.

&gt;Day after day, Patil chose to skip court dates because he didn’t want to face the defence lawyer. Soon, Patil came under scrutiny of the court because he remained absent at the court hearings. The court proceedings were stuck because Patil was absent in the witness-box. It also came to light that he had run away without applying for leave.

&gt;In a strange twist of fate, a man who had actually lodged the first information report against Salman Khan now had an arrest warrant issued against him for not turning up at court hearings. The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to appear for five consecutive court dates.

&gt;As the judge ordered that he be arrested and produced in court, his seniors at the police force simultaneously approved that Patil be sacked from his job because he was absent from duty. His seniors chose to ignore the fact that technically Patil was ‘missing’ and not ‘absent’ according to their own records.

&gt;Nobody was interested in knowing why he had run away from his house. Or, why the same person who was so forthcoming in lodging a complaint against a Bollywood star like Salman Khan, didn’t want to take the witness-box. Patil was never put under any witness protection programme.

&gt;Patil was sent to Arthur Road jail with hardened criminals

&gt;Like how they deal with a hardened criminal, a task force was prepared to nab Patil and find out where he was ‘hiding’. Finding him was easier than anybody had thought because Patil was not hiding anywhere. Ravindra Patil was actually staying in a small hotel in Mahabaleswar, just a few kilometres away from Mumbai. He would come to Mumbai often to meet his wife and family. He was not on the run from the police and was going around telling everybody that he wanted to stay away from the Salman Khan case.

&gt;He had repeatedly requested his colleagues in Mumbai Police to work out a way so that he can be spared from the case. The problem was: He was the prime witness and without him the case didn’t stand a chance in a court of law.

&gt;How many of you hate going to court? How many of you don’t like how witnesses are grilled in criminal cases by defence lawyers? Well, if I go by Patil’s example, then all of you should be put in jail. Believe it or not, Ravindra Patil was sent to jail because of this ‘crime’.

&gt;The special police team swooped down on him, arrested him and produced at the court, the next day. The court sent him to Arthur Road jail, the biggest jail of Mumbai where most of the high-profile criminals are lodged.

&gt;Here are pictures after Patil’s arrest post a raid at a Mahabaleshwar hotel.
patil3
&gt;In Arthur Road jail, Ravindra Patil was incarcerated in a separate cell like they would treat an armed dacoit or a serial killer. Patil submitted fervent pleas that he doesn’t want to be grouped with criminals at the Arthur Road jail but the court was in no mood to relent.

&gt;Twice, Patil filed applications saying that he is a witness and that he be held at Unit nine of the Crime Branch and twice the court ignored the application. In his applications, Patil went on record saying that he went absconding as he was mentally disturbed at the thought of being cross-examined by defence lawyers. But nobody seemed to be interested in what he was saying.

&gt;If the courts didn’t pay heed to his pleas, his employers — the Mumbai Police — seemed to be on some revenge spree. A ‘missing’ Patil suddenly became an ‘absconding’ Patil in their own files and subsequently sacked from his job. This junior-most employee in the force tried every trick in the book to convince his senior officers that he should not be sacked from his job. But nobody was ready to listen.

&gt;A witness was suddenly at the receiving end of it all. Life was dealing this grand witness blows after blows while Salman Khan delivered hits after hits at the box office.

&gt;The last days of Ravindra Patil

&gt;After Patil was let out of jail, he found himself in a strange situation — his family had disowned him and the Mumbai Police was not ready to take him back. Patil didn’t know what to do — suddenly he was the victim because he saw the accident and spoke about it.

&gt;A broken man by then, Ravindra Patil went missing again.

&gt;Patil was finally discovered at the Sewri Municipal hospital in 2007. Patil was begging on the streets of Mumbai before he landed up at the hospital. The years of acute stress coupled with heavy drinking had made his body weak. Worse, he had contracted a drug-resistant tuberculosis which fast tracked him towards an inevitable end.

&gt;Patil wanted to get back in the police force but he was just a bag of bones lying on bed number 189 of ward number four on the fourth-floor of Sewri TB Municipal Hospital. His family members were not aware where he was and nobody had come to see him for a year.

&gt;Here are some moving pictures of Ravindra Patil, just days before his death.

Constable Ravindra Patil died on October 4, 2007.

&gt;Even after his death, there was nobody to take back his body. The friend who had admitted him to the hospital was so scared that he didn’t even inform his family. In the end, his brothers came forward to perform the last rites.

&gt;Before his death, Patil spoke to his friend expressing his wish to get back to the force again while throwing up blood on the cold floors of the Sewri Municipal hospital.

&gt;“I stood by my statement till the end, but my department did not stand by me. I want my job back, I want to survive. I want to meet the police commissioner once,” were his last words.

"&gt;The reality is China barely allows FDI in anything beyond manufacturing..

Such a load of hogwash. Aside from the online domain (FB, Twitter, Amazon all of which are local).

[China allowed 100% FDI in retail in 2004](http://www.theglobaljournals.com/ijar/file.php?val=March_2014_1393846681_38326_71.pdf)

* 26% in 1992 (when India was still a closed economy making the transition to semi open)
* 49% in 2002
* 100% in 2004.

This was enforced in select cities which our current bill (tabled by the UPA II) also does.

To put things into perspective, China opened up in 79 and by 2004 (25 years later) FDI in retail was 100%. India opened up in 91 and here we are, in 2015 still circlejerking over it.

Even your first post here about ""Modi same as UPA"" is full of balderdash. For instance, ""China is all about internal consumption, India is credit bump"".

CHina for your info grew thanks to an export driven economy and only recently been driven by internal consumption.

[According to this Time article](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1957281,00.html)

&gt;&gt;India maintained robust growth without Beijing's hefty stimulus in part because it is less exposed to the international economy. China's exports represented 35% of GDP compared with only 24% for India in 2008. Thus India was afforded more protection from the worst effects of the financial crisis in the West, while China's government needed to be much more active to replace lost exports to the U.S. More significantly, though, India's domestic economy provides greater cushion from external shocks than China's. Private domestic consumption accounts for 57% of GDP in India compared with only 35% in China. India's confident consumer didn't let the economy down. Passenger car sales in India in December jumped 40% from a year earlier. ""What we see [in India] is a fundamental domestic demand story that doesn't stall in the time of a global downturn,"" says Asianomics' Walker.

[This paper goes into more detail](https://ideas.repec.org/a/jge/journl/533.html)

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2012/06/06/why-india-wont-be-the-next-china-and-thats-bullish/) also says India's internal consumption is higher.

And Modi is looking at the Indian economy in a very Keynesian way - pumping in Billions into infra to boost domestic growth, while inviting FDI in Manufacturing. Your ""but Robots"" observation is one that has no bearing on the immediate future. Despite ""Japan running robot factories"", China has added ~ 8-10 Mn new jobs in manufacturing EVERY YEAR since 2006, it added ~ 11 Mn new jobs in 2014 itself.

"It is important to have a little context when analyzing Creed's success. Wind-Up Records, the company that discovered and signed Creed, was (and still is) the most successful independently owned record label in music business history. Creed is, technically speaking, the most popular ""indie"" band of all time. 

To get Creed to the point of having their record go double-diamond, Steve Lerner and Alan Metzger (along with Diana Metzger and Joel Mark) had a supremely well-thought out business plan. In the late 1990's, they were receiving truckloads of media requests for Creed after the success of the first record, My Own Prison. Lerner correctly surmised that they would have better commercial success with the second record, Human Clay, if they limited the media availability of Creed after the first record. The confidence that the man had to have to be the president of a record label, and INDIE label, correctly analyzing that they should say NO to free publicity in order to win the long-game, is astounding. The Beatles literally said no to ZERO media requests during their short existence - at one time they had forty full-time publicists working for them. Before Creed's biggest exposure (who can forget that cover of SPIN?) they were turning down media requests in order not to over-expose themselves. Fucking genius. When Steve explained that to me I almost shit myself. 

Also, you type that Creed was the band that people were embarrassed to like. I think they eventually became that band, but before that they actually got decent record reviews. The worst review of Human Clay was 2.5 stars from Rolling Stone. SPIN put them on the cover for God's sake. Before the White Stripes and the Strokes were pushed insanely hard by RS and Spin, Creed was filling a void for teenagers listening needs as a post-grunge hard rock act. (A fair point - the Strokes and White Stripes first records combined barely sold a million units the first year out. They may get all the credit in the world as ""more important"" acts, but if 20 kids bought a Creed record for everyone one kid that bought a White Stripes record, who really is the more influential band?) Creed were somewhat well liked before collapsing under the weight of Scott Stapp's messianic image makeover and inevitable media over exposure. Of course the next wave of music hit, ala White Stripes and The Strokes and suddenly Creed looked like dinosaurs.

&gt; Or the copyright holders can sue you for up to $150,000 in statutory damages for each of their copyrighted works that you illegally copy or distribute.

So, here's the thing. The music industry has spent the last 20 years and millions of dollars getting the government to institute the fucking **Manhattan Project** of legal precedent for the protection of copyright. Especially music. 

If this was a magazine, congratulations, you now own a magazine company. 3.1 million views at the *minimum value* of $750 per distribution is $2,325,000,000 That's a pretty damn high market cap.

The magazine knows this. They are probably trying to avoid giving a statement to you that admits that they know that they are violating copyright. Because let's face it - the cat is already out of the bag, the damages are done, and they are likely on the hook. Anything they do now is to mitigate that damage, and there is a non-zero chance that stonewalling you is going to make you go away, which wraps the whole thing up in a nice little package for them. 

So, for your information, the magazine ""SidewalkMag"" is published by Factory Media. Their contact page is [here](http://www.factorymedia.com/about). I would send a strongly worded, certified mail to them immediately with the following information - 

1. They have violated US copyright law. They have violated UK copyright law. 
2. The damages for having broken the law to this scale already exceed *all the money*. Seriously, do the math, it is ludicrous.  
3. Demand, at minimum, the average youtube affiliate CPM, plus an arbitrary % penalty, to make this go away. That's $7.60 CPM, from what I can find, so that's around $24k plus the penalty. If they are a youtube affiliate, they have probably already made this from showing your work to others. It's even possible that they have negotiated a higher CPM which would still make this a profitable action for them.
4. Cease and desist from displaying the video in its current state, with a clause that they must link to and properly identify your own hosting
5. Ask they issue a formal apology, explain the situation to their viewership, and refer to the above redirection

I would also send this to both the magazine and the owning company. 

Obviously, IANAL, so anything you actually pursue through the legal system should be thoroughly vetted by whatever lawyer you hire if they ignore the letter. If anyone knows *why* the above wouldn't work, I am definitely interested in hearing it. 

Edit: I had pretty low expectations for the song, but damn, if this mess doesn't land you a deal I would be rather surprised. ",false,false,t1_cr55wbv,chcampb,,0,1431315611,t5_2qh1u,t3_35je0p,t3_35je0p,80,1432889069,0,0,cr55wbv,Music,80,,

"They finally went back to [Komachi's wishlist](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/yahari9-18-19.png) but we still don't have 8mom. Maybe one day. Hachiman's happiness, huh? What a thoughtful little sister. So what is Hachiman's happiness? What is it that Hikigaya Hachiman longs for?

What kind of a monster do you have to be to turn [this](http://i.imgur.com/12DyJ69.jpg) down? So Yui figures out Hachiman helping Isshiki. Not surprising since she's good at reading the air and is sharp enough to pick up subtle things. One thing that stuck out to me was her saying that the ""old"" Yukinon would've accepted that request. The ""old"" Yukinon was more outspoken and assertive. The Yukino now is more passive and mellow. Everything's different since the school trip even if on the surface it seems fine. Faking relationships and pretending everything is all right is taxing especially on someone who hates that. After forcing a smile for so long you become a shadow of your past self and Yui knows this. She felt that taking the request will let Yukino return to her former self and fix the problems the members of the club are facing and not just because it's a good change of pace. Even then she forces a smile. Their relationship would officially be destroyed if she doesn't carry that air. Yui is the person holding the club together right now. [spoils](/s ""In hindsight not taking the request ended up making their bonds stronger. That's next week, boys."")

[Haya x Hiki](http://i.imgur.com/mooceEy.jpg) is the most interesting pair in the series. The dynamic between these two is amazing. It cut out the part where Tobe calls out for Hachiman which shows that he's pretty much a normie at this point. An introverted, cynical normie who's lonely. Still a step up from the loner he was at the beginning of the series. Who am I supposed to self insert into now? But still Hayama confronts him himself so it still the same thing.

&gt;I'm not as nice of a guy as you make me out to be.

Hayama's facade slowly stripping away. In front of Hachiman anyways. Hayama doesn't lose much showing it to him. Until then Hachiman never really looked past his action and words like he did with Haruno. He always ""idolized"" him as the perfect, nice guy like he did with Yukino much earlier in the series. He has an idea that the Hayama everyone knows isn't the real Hayama but having it coming out of the horse's mouth was something else. I really wanted to see Hayama's [cold glare...](http://i.imgur.com/ooQkS6y.jpg)

Isshiki says the bag isn't as heavy but [it still seems heavy.](http://i.imgur.com/Dtnhqma.jpg) Fucking Tamanawa draining Isshiki's life force with SYNERGY. Isshiki bears a large burden being the student council President and having to COOPERATE with another incompetent first year President who wants to BRAINSTORM all the fucking time and never reaches a conclusion. Not even the [elementary schoolers](http://i.imgur.com/wdLc1Bl.jpg) know what the fuck they're supposed to be doing. Good thing they have a [selfless warrior](http://i.imgur.com/Lfq3f9z.jpg) to ask for them.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. They cut out Kei-chan. Why does FEEL have against Kawasaki? They'll show her eventually r-right guys? Along with all the other Sakisaki moments they cut out, r-right guys?

Now we're at not Saize with Tostuka. I'll just skip that. ^^^:\^) Wow someone who isn't a loser in high school actually admires Hachiman. Someone who actually sees his worth without the stupid Batman shit.

Even Hachiman himself realizes that his methods don't really help anyone and it just ends up hurting others. No, he always knew that but was it correct to do anything at all?

[Orimoto](http://i.imgur.com/APNtxAC.jpg) actually being considerate of Hachiman's feelings. Orimoto was always a nice person. She even went out her way to talk to someone like Hachiman. Even her laughing at him was her teasing him like how Yukino constantly bagged on him. But unlike Yukino Orimoto came off as cruel and as a bully to Hachiman, Hayama, and the audience. Now Orimoto became aware of that. I still can't forgive her constant ""SORE ARUs"" during the meeting, though. Holy fuck that's annoying.

[Dat hat.](http://i.imgur.com/ED7rgJO.jpg) Dat sass. Just as expected she's still alone. Rather than helping her get friends he opted destroy the friendships of people around her so she won't be bullied. Just like every other problem he solves it only fixes it temporarily.

[Aww yiss.](http://i.imgur.com/22FFzvO.jpg) Oklahoma Fried Chicken. My favorite. Elevens have a weird tradition of eating ~~K~~OFC for Christmas for some reason.

[Fuck.](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_06.jpg) [This](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_09.jpg) [entire](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_12.jpg) [scene](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_13.jpg) [was](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_15.jpg) [well](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_20.jpg) [done.](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_201.jpg) They really went all out in that scene. Everything about it was amazing. The scenery, the voice acting, the music. The piano version of Harumodoki was playing. *I need that.* Even Spyro says it's better in the anime than the novels. It was fucking great. [spoils](/s ""I have high fucking hopes for *that* scene. It's gonna be episode 9, friends."") What the anime left out was Hachiman making excuses to leave early *every day* so to Yukino it seems like he's just forcing himself to go even if he doesn't want to. Forcing himself so that she won't get hurt. If their relationship can be broken by something as simple as that is it even worth preserving? 

The ED was the same but different. I made a quick [WebM of it.](http://a.pomf.se/wktwsy.webm) The most obvious change of course is the tone and the Hayama Saori solo. They also omitted Yui and Hachiman in [these](https://kyakka.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/zoku7_40.jpg) [parts.](http://i.imgur.com/Hv0U8il.jpg) The belief the Hachiman and Yukino held on to was gone. Her interactions with Yui just amounts to fake smiles and fake happiness. At this point Yukino is pretty much alone again. The tone and lyrics of the ED reflect the show in its current state and as a whole very well. I'll dissect it even though it's straightforward and easy to understand for the most part because fuck you, I'm bored.

&gt;Whether it's school uniforms or textbooks\ There's no way it can be changed on a whim

Pretty easy. Nothing can be changed easily especially people. And uniforms and textbooks apparently.

&gt;It's fun even if it's hollow\ We'll continue to swim through those times

Despite the fact that their relationship is filled with fake smiles and fake friendliness they still enjoy each other's company and will continue to do so.

&gt;In order to keep this calmness\ We keep reaching to the formula of how to act

The calmness refers to to the state of the club: free of conflict. In order to preserve it they fake friendliness by acting how they ""normally"" would. It's only a ""sense of calmness"" and not the genuine thing.

&gt;If we know that this is love\ The strength called ""loneliness"" starts to break down

&gt;This fragile everyday world can easily crumble

[spoils](/s ""It's pretty obvious that both Yui and Yukino want the 8inches. If either of them knew that they both liked him the club will probably disappear. Look at Yui in volume 3 almost quit the club because she thought Yukino and Hachiman were dating. 'Koi' can also translate to 'good will.' Hachiman uses his loneliness as a shield to protect him from harm like 'good girls' and he'll have to drop that if he's going trust people."") 

&gt;These feelings forced out\ Still remain cowardly\ And hurt every one of us

By not being true to their words and feelings they end up hurting people. Yukino specifically got hurt by Hachiman's ""betrayal."" Both Yui and Hachiman are also hurting for slightly different reasons.

 I wonder what will happen to it next episode... Maybe have Takuya Eguchi sing it? I'm really looking forward to next episode considering what's going to be in it.

Its official Shirou is officially butchered as a character . Even I cant defend ufotable and miura now from the VN purist damn... why ufo why....

Edit : Let the down votes begin but seriously man I know /r/anime loves Ufotable and ubw but how can you not say this episode was not butchered from the VN ? the rin x saber was one of the defining moments in UBW and fate series and it was rushed

I find that remark far too one-sided, because many of us do think the show follows its own method to the madness. There is a certain reasoning at work, beneath all the superficial insanity or implausible situations. And the key to understanding it is, precisely, Lelouch himself.

"Well you guys were right, Yuuta was indeed a girl (Biologically) and Yuuta bodysnatched himself.

***
**Stuff we learned this episode:**

* ""Zero"" is Ito's homeroom teacher possessed by Qmay and is a total Yandere

* Yubafy is caused by Hercules' virus, it takes away the body's limiters, but also destroys it in the process.

* Qmay's goal is W

* Yuuta can see his alt-timeline ghost self

* The eyecatch card changed back....

* Meika said all servers were normal, yet the asteroid struck apparantly...

* Yuuta is biologically a girl, full name Iridatsu Yu

* Meika and Mikatan met 8 years ago

* Mikatan first Yutafied at age 13

* Meika has a giant mecha

* All the book says is U-Turn!

* Ghost + Cinnamon + Yuuta's Yutafy &gt; Yutafying badasses

***
**Resolved Mysteries:**

* The body snatcher is past alt-timeline Yuuta and he had the book

* Zero was Ito's homeroom teacher and fixated on her explaining the videos, emails, and killings.

* Qmay wants the bear so he can keep Yutafying.

***
**Ongoing Mysteries:**

&gt; How did Yuuta obtain the book?

* He comments that it's a fake so he made it himself I guess

&gt; Alt timeline Yuuta's behavior

* Why is he dressing up as a superhero?

* How does he know about Meika's innerworkings enough to fix her?

* He doesn't like Qmay or the NSA.

* Damn, he likes being dramatic.

&gt; What is the Mastermind's goal?

* He was smirking both times we've seen him.

* *He's so relevant as the last lab child, but we've seen no sign of him*

&gt; What's the deal with the cat?

* *Does he live through each loop? Is he the first Yuuta?*

&gt; Yuuta

* *Definitely related to the labs, most likely the 3rd girl there*

* *What's he gonna do now? Kenji only made a few appearances and he pretty much stayed away from everyone else the entire time.*

&gt; Mikatan

* She has a fear of turtles; the Qmay group's symbol looks a lot like a turtle...

* What were those pills she was taking for?

* *Why was she willing to faint/die right there instead of revealing her need for pills?*

&gt; Meika

* She was built 20 years ago

* *Met Mikatan 8 years ago*

* How did Yuuta earn her complete trust?

&gt;Ito

* She gave 2 contradicting stories on how she found the bear, which was real?

&gt;Rabura

* What did she send when she was possessed 24 years ago?

&gt;How did Qmay acquire Yutafy?

* Presumably the lab research went to him but you never know.

* His spirit getting kicked out was just black mist....

"Okay, here's the formula:

Your first sentence is your thesis statement.  It doesn't matter if you're writing fiction, nonfiction, poetry, a play.  The very first line you put to paper should condense exactly the material that you want to convey throughout the rest of the book.

What do I mean by this?

Here's what: the central theme of your book or short story or haiku or whatever should be identifiable between ""Chapter 1"" and the first full stop.  If you're writing about cats, talk about felines in your first sentence.  If you're writing about the duality of man, introduce a character with paradoxical traits.  If you're writing medieval scholastic erotica, introduce Ockam and Aquinas in full sixty-nine.  You're options for themes are endless.  Here's some classic examples:

&gt; It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.

&gt; It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

&gt; I am an invisible man.

&gt; Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond.

&gt; See the child.

&gt; ""Sleep well, dear.""

&gt; For a man of his age, fifty two, divorced, he has, to his mind, solved the problem of sex rather well.

&gt; It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.

Every single one of these authors followed that rule.  It's not a rule.  The only rule is ""there are exceptions"", but it's a good practice.

Now let's focus on making openings even better.

Your first sentence, in addition to laying out the framework for your story, should also introduce at least one character.  All but one of the examples above do this.  Two of them explicitly introduce two characters, and three more implicitly introduce additional characters.  As well, your sentence should have an exciting primary action.  This does not have to be ""kill"" or ""love"" or, as is the case with the example from Plath, ""electrocuted"".  It can be as simple as ""sleep"" as we see from Mishima, ""was well known"", as we see in Achebe, even ""was"", from Dickens.  The action does not have to be striking and powerful, it just has to grab the attention of the reader.

Finally, it's a good idea to use a rhetorical device.  Since *A Tale of Two Cities* has been falling short in other categories, I'll pick on Dickens.  His use of [symploce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symploce) immediately grabs your attention, doesn't it?  In one of my works in progress, I open with a combination of anaphora and rhyme.  This is not a necessity, but it's a good idea. 

Great, now we know how to write a first sentence.  What about the rest of it?  You have exactly ten-minutes to wow your reader.  That's less than four-thousand words.

"Spot on! 

As for why they are so interested in what other people do, I think I have a few ideas. One is that it challenges their belief system. They are taught that non-believers are really miserable deep down inside, that they are trying to fill the void in their soul (where Jesus should be) with earthly pleasures. The sinner feels this void instinctively, but refuses to heed ""God's calling"", and just continues to try to fill that gap with sinful things. This makes them progressively more miserable, until they finally turn to God or are warped into a hateful, spiteful, bitter shell of their former selves. In a Christian's mind, every single human being has this void in their souls. This was drilled into my head *constantly* as a child... so why does this make the Christian obsessed with the lives of others? Because they are desperately seeking confirmation of their beliefs. Other people, non-Christians, *must* be crippled with guilt and depression on some level. The Christian *knows* that God has improved his life, lifting his burden of guilt and allowing him to know true joy, and so he looks for signs of this abject misery in the lives of non-Christians to confirm what he already believes. When he does not find such evidence, it challenges his belief system, which makes him very, very uncomfortable. He must dig deeper, or simply insist that his target really is miserable and would be so much happier if only they accepted God. Sinners who live full, happy lives are an impossibility in the Christian mind, and evidence that  they really can be happy is like a stinging barb worked into his foot, that he feels with every step taken.

7% prefer to be ambiguous and/or respectful of religion by claiming agnosticism. I also usually find that those who claim to be agnostic do not understand what it means and sees atheism and agnosticism as mutually exclusive rather than referring to different things - i.e. belief and knowledge.

"This type of rehashing has actually lead to death at least once in history.

In 1566, a man named Gwarthgydd Meyer was an unemployed vagrant in the town of Ebbw Vale, Wales. Gwarthgydd was known as a lovable drunk who often entertained the town with song, dance, and inebriated miming. He slept in a barn of a local farmer, and generally kept to himself when he was not merry making. However, one day Gwarthgydd witnessed the farmer do something hilarious. The farmer, March Pembroke, fell off a bale of hay and landed on a pitchfork. He was partially impaled in the buttocks, and it was months before he fully recovered. 

Most of the town felt sorry for March, but Gwarthgydd thought it was the funniest event he had ever witnessed. Soon, everything he did whilst drinking was an attempt to mock March. He wrote songs about pitchforks and behinds. He invented new dances to embarrass the farmer. He even performed a three hour miming act of the incident. The townsfolk asked him to stop, but he persisted. It was tolerated for many nights, but eventually he took it too far. Gwarthgydd brought a pitchfork into the bar one night and started playfully stabbing the townsfolk with it. He was repeatedly asked to stop, but to no avail. After many hours of annoying the entire town, tempers reached a boiling point, and Gwarthgydd was stoned to death in the town square. 

Just goes to show, there can be serious consequences to rehashing old jokes!

"As I said elsewhere:

Content always has a creator, and those individuals deserve credit for their work. Sure, it may be something as simple as an image of overpriced soap in a toilet bowl, able to be imitated by anyone... but as the popularity of the picture shows, clearly it's worthy of note to some people. It's not even a question of profit, either; it's just nice for someone to be able to say ""Hey, I made this!"" without having other such claims drown them out.

Honestly, for as much as the Internet claims to hate Thomas Edison, we all seem pretty strongly inclined to imitate him.

In fact... you know what? I propose a new word:

------

**Edison**    
*noun*    
[ɛd ə sən]

1. An individual who benefits from the work of another.
2. A plagiarist.
3. Someone who fails to cite a source for content they use.

""*Man, I hate Kevin! He stole my screenplay and passed it off as his own!*""    
""*What an* ***edison*** *that guy is!*""

------

**Edison**    
*verb*    
[ɛd ə sən]

1. To plagiarize or otherwise benefit from the work of another without crediting them.

""*Seriously, Kevin is a goddamned leech. That idiot just* ***edisoned*** *my doctoral thesis!*""

------

Also, we know some of you like to smoke cannabis, and drink. I really don't give a fucking shit what you put in your body, I'd prefer if you didn't do that, but I really don't give a shit. However, I do ask that you morons out there, yeah, you know who the fuck you are. Stop brining drugs and alcohol on campus, and showing up to class so drunk or high that you're passing out at your desk, throwing up on the floor, and just generally smelling like fucking shit. We don't want that. Do that shit on your own time. You keep doing that shit, you're not going to amount to anything in life, and you should probably just drop out and start working at McDonald's, or get in the welfare line. Like I said, I really don't give a fucking shit if you want to do that, in fact some of the best students here probably do that fucking shit. But it's you fucking idiots that keep showing up to FUCKING CLASS! like that, that are pissing me the fuck off. Anybody else that comes into my office this year for ANYTHING that fucking stupid, is gone, they're never coming back. I don't care if it's your first offence, your ass is never coming back to this school again. * switches to calm voice * Now I hope see you all at the hockey game tonight, tickets are $5 in advance, and $8 at the door, enjoy your assembly. * walks off stage to standing ovation from the 90% of the school who weren't idiots, sits down next to Principal, who is a row in front of me * That's how it's done.

"Badabing something i can help with. On my second account so i don't get busted. 

First of all do you have a reservation? If you have proof of a reservation or put in a deposit then that will boost your arguing ability. 

Here are some numbers: 

Customer Service: 877-460-4863
Customer Service #2: 866-756-5750
Dealer Relations: 888-806-5000
Budget Help Desk: 1800-822-2847 option 3 and wait. 

Call them in THAT order. If you're asked where you got that number state you got it from as i quote ""one of the many dealer's I've been talking with."" Say it in that way and they'll just move on. Don't take no for an answer and get compensation/ free miles/ and discounts. Are you moving one way or local? 

First number is Customer service for customers
second is for dealers
Third is for dealers only when they have issues with policies. Person at that number is nice and should help you get straightened out. Be sure to say what i quoted above if you talk to this number or the last number. And last but not least if you have issues with the third number or cant get ahold of it call the last number. (you shouldn't have issues but you may) The last number will NOT be able to help you. They have no power to assist. But they're great at arguing. When you call them tell them your situation and say you've tried every number they give to you. You've called customer service and they keep referring you around or aren't helping. Ask the help desk to stay on the line with you while you talk to customer service and to help make sure someone helps you. 

Also have the Dealer call their inventory manager or territory performance manager. If you can be lenient on location you get the truck from or even days you get and have the truck you may be able to get an awesome deal. 

Wont give you why i know this but I promise it will all work. PM me if you want much more detailed information. I can try to help you as much as i can. If you have a reservation number get that to me by the end of the hour and i can assist more.

"Not quite: the flag predates Cap by almost 50 years

&gt;The origins of the current flag of Puerto Rico, **adopted by the commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1952**, can be traced to 1868, when the first Puerto Rican flag, ""The Revolutionary Flag of Lares"", was conceived by Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and embroidered by Mariana ""Brazos de Oro"" Bracetti. This flag was used in the short-lived Puerto Rican revolt against Spanish rule in the island, known as ""El Grito de Lares"".[1][2]

&gt;Juan de Mata Terreforte, an exiled veteran of ""El Grito de Lares"" and Vice-President of Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, in New York City, adopted the flag of Lares as the flag of Puerto Rico until **1892, when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee.** The new flag, which consisted of five equal horizontal bands of red (top and bottom) alternating with white; a blue isosceles triangle based on the hoist side bears a large, white, five-pointed star in the center, was **first flown in Puerto Rico on March 24, 1897**, during the ""Intentona de Yauco"" revolt.

"You're getting into the distinctions between reference, allusion, sampling, homage, and plagiarism.

Plagiarism is the *wrongful* appropriation of the majority or substantial portion of another's work, with or without attribution. It normally occurs without attribution and normally in journalism and academia, where people expect attribution of their work and expect substantial original work.

Rappers and performing artists often make reference to other works or outright sample *portions* of other works with the understanding that the artist being sampled allows the sampling and that the source material is recognisable. The Amen Break is the most famous and ubiquitous of these. Sometimes artists don't have that understanding or the source material is not readily recognisable or no attribution is given — The Verve lifted their backing track for *Bittersweet Symphony* wholesale from a Rolling Stones track, without permission, though it was readily recognisable; Timbaland lifted an entire chiptune from Janne Suni, *Acidjazzed Evening*, as backing for one of his tracks and tried to claim it was original.

In graphic design, elements get reworked and reappropriated often,meith varying degrees of legitimacy; if I re-draw and re-imagine a graphic element that isn't trademarked and use it, is it parody? Is it misappropriation? It's hard to say.

Target's graphic was a dead-on copy of the designer's work; their use of her design is clearly and independently condemnable.

"It's not like proportional representation is a perfect system either. It can give small fringe parties disproportionately large amounts of power if they are needed to form a coalition. Politicians aren't responsible for any specific geological constituency which is problematic in a country as large and diverse as the United States. You also can't hold individual members of the party accountable for their actions.

Because the United States is so large and diverse you would likely end up with many parties with wildly different agendas. This just leads right back to the inability to get anything done.

As evidenced by this. No charges were pressed. He never even went to court. But, despite that, his life is still ruined.

If you want people to go to the criminal justice system for treatment for their children when this happens, you need the criminal justice system to respect their confidentiality, *forever*, and to *treat them effectively*. If you want to prevent further attacks, you need to treat young offenders. 

This leak of information has probably done more to encourage future attacks in other families than anything else could have.

1949 - The Central Intelligence Agency Act is passed, allowing the CIA to keep many of its organizational details and functions a secret, as well as allowing it to use confidential fiscal procedures and exempting it from many of the usual limitations on the use of federal funds.  
  
1949 - The CIA sponsors a coup in Syria which overthrows the democratically elected government of Shukri al-Quwatli. Al-Quwatli had blocked the creation of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, which begins to move forward immediately after the coup.  
  
1953 - The U.S. and British governments carry out Operation Ajax to overthrow the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, after he nationalizes their oil industry. An absolute monarchy is placed in power.  
  
1954 - The CIA carries out Operation PBSUCCESS, a military coup which overthrows Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán. The coup is carried out at the urging of the United Fruit Company after Guzmán expropriates some of their idle land to distribute to peasant farmers. The coup triggers the Guatemalan Civil War which kills 140,000 to 250,000 Guatemalans.


1954 - The CIA carries out Operation PBHISTORY to gather intelligence on Latin American Communists and share said information with Anti-Communist regimes.

1961 - CIA-supported paramilitary units, backed by U.S. bombers, attempt a coup at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba but are defeated.


1961 - Following the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, Air Force General Edward Lansdale launches Operation Mongoose (also known as Special Group Augmented or simply The Cuban Project) to wage a covert terrorism campaign against Cuba.


1961 - A coup deposes the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba. He is captured and executed with the help of the CIA.  
  
1964 - Mary Pinchot Meyer, former wife of CIA official Cord Meyer and mistress to JFK, is murdered. Meyer was friends with Timothy Leary, and had told him and others that she was trying to turn Kennedy on to LSD to get him to realize how pointless the Cold War was. She also told friends of a diary she kept which they should safeguard if anything should happen to her. The morning after the murder, friends of Meyer's go to her house to search for the diary but find CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton already there. Cord Meyer will later be named in the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt as a co-conspirator in Kennedy's assassination.  
  
1964 - Cancer researcher Mary Sherman is murdered. Her body is found burnt and stabbed in her apartment. Sherman had been friends with suspected JFK assassination conspirator David Ferrie who will himself be found dead in his apartment a few years later.

Fellow naval officer Dennis David has testified that Pitzer showed him autopsy slides of the slain president which contradicted the official story. Instead, the slides are consistent with video of the assassination in which Kennedy's head twists back and to the left, suggesting that the fatal shot came from ahead of him and to the right. Lt. Col. Dan Marvin of the U.S. Army will later testify that he turned down a CIA contract to assassinate Pitzer.  
  
1967 - Bolivian Special Forces, with the aid of the CIA, capture and execute Che Guevara.

&gt;The father has now married and taken custody of his daughter.

Hold up.  She was declared an unfit mother because she lied to some dude who knocked her up??

A sperm-donor has absolutely no rights concerning his child.  A woman may legally abort her child or give that child up for adoption with or without the sperm-donor's consent.  He has absolutely zero say in that.  If she decieved him about what happened to the baby she carried, that is of no consequence, at all.  He had no right to know in the first place.

If we are going to follow this precedent, then we must require that all women who become pregnant must inform their sperm-donors of the fact, and give them honest and accurate reporting of the condition of their spawn.  That's hideous and ridiculous.

How could it? If that video can prejudice a jury, surely releasing this can too:

&gt;March 16, 2012 - Authorities release seven 911 calls from the night of the shooting. In one of the 911 recordings, Zimmerman, against the advice of the 911 dispatcher, follows Martin. In one of the recordings, a voice screams ""Help, help!"" in the background, followed by the sound of a gunshot.

http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/05/us/trayvon-martin-shooting-fast-facts/

The police released the 911 calls over a month before charging Zimmerman. Yet that did not prejudice the jury...

So what is different this time? The fact the accused is a cop?

&gt;Does the public need to see someone get shot?

Yes. It is our *duty* to monitor the behaviour of our public servants. *We* are their boss. If cops are shooting people, then we have the duty to ensure they are following the law and not abusing the power *we* give them.

After cruising altitude, you're too far away from a tower to make a call.

3. A lot of planes have wifi these days. If this one did, she could have used a messenger app, facebook, email, or local police website to contact someone. 

4. Don't focus on making a phone call once the plane is in the air, ask the crew if the pilots can contact someone. If it's a grave situation, they may be able to contact someone on the ground for you.

"Then your teacher was very likely full of crap.

I'm an archaeologist and I spent a lot of time working in review and compliance for cultural resource mitigation. 

It is, in almost all cases, an utter myth that 'the government is going to take my land/bill me/make my life bad/take away my birthday' if you find artifacts on your property.

There are two very specific situations where the Federal or state governments have oversight on these matters:

1) You find graves.  This has nothing to do with Native Americans, but rather is governed under grave desecration laws.  Unmarked, previous unknown graves essentially never result in legal issues for the property owner and, unless you're a moron, if you're finding human remains on your property, you SHOULD be calling somebody.

2)  The laws that people think are the Evil Empire are the 1966 Historic Preservation Act that created the NHRP (National Registry of Historic Places) and the 1979 Archaeological Resources Protection Act.  

The key on ARPA is that it governs only **Federal** and **Indian** lands.  Private property is not part of it.  If you're picking up arrowheads or excavating in Yellowstone, you're in trouble.  If you're picking up arrowheads along a stream in your grandpa's pasture, you're fine.

For NRHP evaluation, the confusion comes in because it can have jurisdiction over private property.  However, in order for this to be the case, the project **must** be considered an 'undertaking' under Section 106.  A Federal undertaking is a project, activity, or program funded, wholly or partially, by a Federal Agency.  Dig a ginormous pond on your property and find a village site?  Not covered.  Get a grant from the NRCS to build a ginormous pond on your property and find a village?  Definitely covered.

There's also a third law, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), that is relevant here.  However, this again requires Federal money to be involved in order to have jurisdiction.  Private property is specifically exempted.
  
Ergo, it is exceedingly unlikely that small, residential housing projects are under the NRHP umbrella, unless the contractor or home-owner was specifically taking grant money directly for the project (tax breaks typically don't count), in which case that's sort of their own fault and the price of admission for using tax-payer money.

There's always the anecdotal case of ""My friend owned a historic home and they wouldn't let him paint it a certain color or remodel the bathroom.""  That is **not** a Federal law or part of the aforementioned acts.   That is an HOA or other local governing body imposing restrictions and has nothing to do with Fed regs.

Now, all that said, digging up archaeological sites for the sake of souvenir hunting sucks for everybody.  It's a common misconception that archaeologists are only concerned with the object (""This belongs in a museum!!"").  In fact, the main concern is **context**.  In other words, what cultural and natural processes led this thing to look the way it does and be found in this specific place at this specific time?  These go to the questions of patterns human behavior and site taphonomy, which is what archaeology is actually about.  Now, artifacts are cool, and we like having them to look at and study, but we can take pictures and get measurements, etc., of the artifacts.  You can only excavate a site once and then all that information is lost.

I personally know several academic archaeologists that spend a good deal of time working on private land.  They get to excavate and then all artifacts go to the private land owner to do with as he or she pleases.

Ah, I've had this similar discussion in regards to GamerGate, Wil Wheaton and the deanonymization of society.  

We currently have a generation gap in concepts and ideas in regards to how the internet is utilized.  

Back, back, way on back before I was even born the denizens of the internet congregated through screen names, aliases or obfuscated identities. This was because of a mixture of character limits, free speech philosophy and foresight into what a society would be without this layer of pseudonymity. You were ""frecklefart88"" for one aspect, or maybe all, of your persona as presented online. Because of the lack of easy to create digital photos or the redundancy of proving identity, those screen names became a facet of someone's persona and could either be clung to or discarded as needed. Why? The retcon tells us it's because it was a wild west back then, but that's not true. It is because ideas and the communication of them was tantamount to the internet experience, ""The truth has power because it's the truth. And because it is the truth, that makes it *just*."" Identity was irrelevant.  

Enter social media, and Facebook demanding identity tied to profile.  

Now we have an internet built around not on how your ideas work and how your thought process goes, but who you are as a person. Personality, celebrity, *centralized* driven internet. If you're proven wrong about something, it's not because your idea is stupid and there needs to be found either a workaround or competing idea that does work, it's because *you're* stupid. Everything becomes an attack on yourself.  

It complicates further as more sites that build around the generation of ideas or even a marketplace built around the compensation of them, then rely on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, et al. in order to do the work of verifying identity for them, tying an identity to an account or an idea or a work or even just merely an observer, a browsing history (take Massdrop for instance! Or ride sharing services that require such account rather than forming an account directly in their service and payment separated from said systems) in order to build a profile around what is specifically and uniquely *you*, and not some facet of you.  

That's why you see opposing persons on a debate, such as GamerGate, come from both sides of the divide. The ego-centric, brand-oriented, self-promoting user whose own name is tied to all they've said and done and worked on, versus the person as embodied by data and information (overly simplified in the battle cry by the latter calling out the former, as ""Facts don't real, only feels.""). Hope McKenna's every movement and breath in the meatspace doesn't revolve around decentralization and disruptive tech and controversial ideas, but HopeStillFlies *does*, and when Hope is done talking about those things for the day, she logs off, mentally clocks out, and clocks back in on what she wants to do for that moment (for example, gaming forums, Felonious Monk).  

Because of social media culture, that separation is viewed from the same ideology as the ""[nothing to hide argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument)"", when the reality is simply that there should be an allowance for a separation of the multiple aliases not only for the organization of information, but for the purpose of exercising proper mental health for the user. Otherwise, when we have a situation where information from different sources or ideas have to be melded together in order to fit *The Grand Narrative*, sometimes dilemmas, or conflicts can occur. Instead of the acknowledgement that some ideas cannot peacefully co-exist, we get the early seeds of *doublethink*.  

Wheaton argues, without much thought put into it, that all internet presences should be legally required to bind to a personal identity, even further not just one centralized identity but one that requires the use of your real name. To further how doublethink works into this, the culmination of his argument is that if everyone has to use their real identity, then activities such as doxxing or abuse, according to his logic, would cease. But this does relate back to the argument of ""if you outlaw all the guns, only criminals will have guns"". Stripping away a necessary mechanism for empowering the self to protect their body and mind in order to expose them to the world at the mercy of those who will inevitably *not* follow the rules this new order.   

Social Media, in the ultimate irony of the ubiquitous (but not free!) distribution of information is actually *stifling* the creation of *new* information and generating new sandboxes in which ideas can be played with, set aside and never played with again, or if they prove their worth pulled into the world as a whole.  

For further reading on these concepts and ideas including opposing viewpoints in order to better inform yourself of the philosophy of this culture that is being created as you read this, I recommend these books:

"Was it Beau Biden who busted Larry Sinclair after a press conference outing Barrack Obama for gay sex and crack cocaine limo dates?

http://chasvoice.blogspot.com/2012/05/obama-his-ex-lovers-obscene-vid.html

For a review of Joe Biden’s accomplishments:

1. He had the Delaware Attorney General’s office create a bogus Grand Jury indictment.

2. He had the DC police illegally arrest and detain Lawrence Sinclair.

3. While in custody he deprived Mr. Sinclair of his needed medications as he has a brain tumor.

4. While in custody he had the DC police “loose” Mr. Sinclair so legal counsel could not find him.

5. While in custody he deprived Mr. Sinclair of phone access.

6. While in custody he had the Federal Attorney attempt to hold Mr. Sinclair indefinitely on outrageously high bail.

All of those facts are human rights violations against international law which belong in The Hague.

Out of custody, Joe Biden, as this was coming out of Delaware was sending out forged legal papers to Social Security to get Mr. Sinclair’s benefits cancelled which he depends on and then had him terrorized in threatening to make him repay all benefits.

Out of custody, the Delaware Attorney General’s office has been seeding false stories into the press.

Out of custody, the Delaware Attorney General’s office via Susan Dwyer has refused to provide Mr. Sinclair’s legal counsel with evidence of charges which they are illegally quoting to the press.

Currently, Joe Biden, via his son, Delaware Attorney General and the above deputy, Susan Dwyer, are attempting to imprison Mr. Sinclair for life on a misdemeanor, blackmailing him to plead guilty on the twisting of the law “he is a career criminal”.
That charge is meant for criminals who are committing ceaseless crimes in the said state in violent crimes, not for petty theft. (Note Mr. Sinclair has shown proof there was no crime in Delaware and in fact by the outrageous “check cashing charges” he was made to pay he in this is the victim which Delaware should be investigating.)” [link](http://citizenwells.com/2008/08/24/joe-biden-obama-larry-sinclair-delaware-gulag-attorney-general-biden-91108-socialism-08-new-castle-county-delaware-superior-court-biden-country/)",false,false,t1_crqua9s,e-socrates,,0,1433083402,t5_2qh3l,t3_37wv18,t3_37wv18,-10,1433497711,0,0,crqua9s,news,-10,,

"I have heard this argued many times and on many occasions I have attempted to caution that it is only reflective of one step on a longer path, without necessarily looking further down the road.  To be honest, I have never been successful at spurring much rational debate, but here goes anyway.

The balance between the lawfull and unlawfull is a precarious one, and the comments by Marko Kloos are spot on, a firearm is a big weight, and goes a long way to balancing the scale.

The problem that I have however is twofold.  Firstly, the impact of an incident is determined by the total weight on the balance, not the weight on one side.  Consider the total result of a mugging by an armed mugger against an armed victim versus an unarmed mugger vs an unarmed victim.

The counter argument that is usually put forward is that the mugger would have injured the victim anyway, potentially lethally.  Maybe in some cases yes, but not in all.

Now look further down the road.  Kloos is willing to admit that without guns the physically superior party will win a confrontation, but completely ignores the fact that if both parties are armed, it is other factors that determine who wins the confrontation.  Those factors, in order of importance, include the element of surprise or initiative, tactical positioning and firepower.

For all three of these factors, the advantage lies overwhelmingly with the initiator, a fact that has been borne out by the experience in countries such as South Africa.

If the initiator assumes the victim is carrying a concealed weapon, it is remarkably easy to walk up behind them and simply shoot them, then steal their car, money or in many cases, firearm.

If the initiator is aware of an armed and aware victim, it is easy to overcome this through a tactical advantage, such as a long gun at a range that is less effective for a handgun, or simply by increasing the amount of force through the use of accomplices.

In all these scenarios, the total weight on the scale is dramatically increased.

Step one may include an armed populace, and may be an improvement, but this is not to say that the next step to an armed, aware, willing and tactically advantaged criminal is going to be similarly improved.

The argument brought forward last time I raised this ?.  This is America, not Africa.  Yes in the USA an armed populace may be the final step, but it is always worth considering the alternative that this is just one step on a longer road.

"It's to do with the 410km (olivine-&gt;spinel) and 660km (spinel-&gt;perovskite) phase boundaries. Earthquakes this deep have a different cause than normal tectonics

Source: am Geophysicist

*

Edit: People asked for a more in depth explanation:

* Minerals have a number different structures they can be in
* These are called phases and the different phases are more or less compact than each other and have different properties
* At greater depths the pressure (and temperature) is higher and thus the more compact structures of the minerals are preferred (this is quite a big simplification really, sometimes temperature inhibits a change rather than promotes it etc but this works enough for a general explanation)
* One of the most prominent minerals that has significant structure changes is called Olivine
* Olivine is present in subducting slabs from Oceanic-Continental collision zones - subduction zones - (like the one on the Eastern side of Japan)
* The Olivine within the slab is carried deeper with the slab, beginning in its normal 'Olivine' form
* Olivine changes first to a structure similar to Spinel and then to a structure similar to Perovskite as it moves to higher pressures and temperatures (and thus as it moves deeper into the earth)
* These changes from one structure to another are called phase changes
* However, for it to change, it requires an *activation energy*. This is a bit of energy required to kick start the change (even if the phase change releases energy in the end) . If it doesn't have this kick-off energy, then it doesn't change structure ([Figure for explanation](http://i.imgur.com/tN1jZjs.png))
* NOTE: this whole process can happen at either the 410km (Olivine-&gt;spinel) boundary depth or the 660km (Spinel-&gt;perovskite) boundary depth

* I'll explain the 660km boundary as that's where this earthquake was
* Without the activation energy, the subducting slab (carrying the olivine which has already passed the 410km and thus is now spinel) can move below the depth it would normally change without changing to perovskite.
* As the slab gets deeper, it deflects a bit off the 660km boundary that marks where the rest of the mantle has changes from Spinel to perovskite (although the slab hasn't yet) and bends
* This bending causes compressional forces on the bottom side of the slab
* Once the compressional forces get big enough, it can crack the slab slightly - providing the activation energy needed to kick-start the phase change from Spinel to Perovskite.
* This structure change actually releases energy greater than the energy put in and thus provides activation energy for other nearby minerals to change too
* Suddenly, we have a massive chain reaction, with a big region of the Spinel in the slab changing phase
* This releases lots of energy (seismic energy)
* This is the earthquake that we detect!",false,false,t1_crpwmqb,ivereaddit,,0,1432996877,t5_2qh3l,t3_37u24a,t1_crpwgmv,174,1433392899,0,0,crpwmqb,news,174,,

"The article says the charge was sexual exploitation of a child, but it said the only act was possession of child pornography. Was he also producing it, and that just didn't factor into the article? 

If it *was* mere possession, this sentence seems about right, and I'd even argue that making the guy register as a sex offender--even if it's just for the term of the deferred probation, registered sex offenders are in for some cruel and unusual punishment for being, technically, ""free""--for possessing a few buckets of zeroes and ones that displayed abhorrent acts is bordering on unnecessarily harsh. 

This may be tough for people to grasp, and you may not want to, because it sounds icky, but merely possessing illegal pornography is a victimless crime. 

I know, I know, ""what about the people on the screen, they're not victims?"" Yes, they are. Of *course* they are. They are victims of the person producing the imagery, the one *actually* exploiting and hurting them. They are not the abject victims of the person possessing the imagery sometime later.

The argument that a person caught possessing illegal imagery sometime after it was produced *in any way* victimized the subjects of that illegal imagery, and should be punished accordingly, is really quite disturbing when you think about it.

Just imagine that mode of thinking (""If you 'create a market' for this illegal, abhorrent thing by wanting to possess it, you should be punished just as though you produce it"") applied to other things. Are people who buy Nikes now fugitives from justice? What about guys looking to buy a diamond ring for their significant other? How about people that are buying tickets to the World Cup in Qatar?

Yeah, actually she does -- there's a rating in the upper right corner of TV shows advising what kind of content is on the show, and movies have similar warnings and ratings. 

&gt;Do we start giving trigger warnings before fireworks show for veterans that may suffer from PTSD?

Kind of obvious that fireworks might trigger bad responses in people who have trauma from explosions.  But yeah, if I was hanging out with a vet, I would let him know before taking him to a fireworks show -- that sounds like a bad surprise birthday idea.

"I am so tired of people saying ""why did they run?"". Have we not seen enough cops killing innocent people to know why they run. Because they are being hunted.

Did Tamir Rice run? He was 12 and cops murdered him and he did not run. They drove up to him going a zillion miles an hour with guns blazing and murdered him in seconds.   

There has been countless others that did not run and the cops still murdered them. Running has nothing to do with cops murdering citizens, IMO.

Did Freddie Gray run? He was chained in a van when the cops murdered him.

Did Eric Garner run?   Hell how could he have run.   They had him surrounded until tackling and murdering him as paramedics just sat and watched.   No weapon.   Did nothing and cops murder him.

Did John Crawford run? He was a child in a walmart store minding his own business, not running, completely innocent when a cop came in and murdered him for no reason.

Did Darrien Hunt run? No! Cops murdered him for no reason.

Was James Boyd running when the cops murdered him? Hell he was standing on a steep hill, had no where to go when a cop from a pretty good distance murdered him. They could clearly see that he had no weapons and was doing nothing wrong besides being homeless and camping in a deserted area.

Do you get it? Please stop giving the murdering cops the excuse that ""but they were running"". That is a completely absurd statement.

This is just a sample. These are the ones we only know about because of video. You have to believe there are at least 100 times more where cops have murdered an innocent citizen who was NOT running. Please, please stop with the ridiculousness that they ran and deserve. Instead maybe our justice system should not only be locking up these murdering cops but also all the accomplices, and any cop that made a false statement.

"This may get buried but what the heck. 

I just left a company that was a subcontractor for this job and have been privy to some of the meetings held. It's my understanding that when the job went forward with construction, the design was around 50% complete. 

Now, for those generally unfamiliar with how large projects like this go, this is not uncommon. Although it sounds stupid and leaves a lot of unanswered questions, this happens in construction every day. The problem with this particular project came during the completion of the design phase. 

With the ~50% design complete, they had enough to go on to get started and the design firm, which was not the construction company, basically holds meetings with the VA to hash out the rest of the details. And as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. 

It is my understanding that the VA began adding things to the design that were unnecessary and very costly. Seemingly small additions and 'upgrades' to what material was to be used. This added up very quickly. 

In fact, just to keep the project going, the contractor contributed over $200 million of its own money. 

From my standpoint, this project is a VA problem.  I was told that the design firm explicitly told the VA that their choices would make a big change in the budget and that the VA always said they would find the money somehow. I don't think the VA representatives understood the magnitude of their changes. 

What we have here is a failure to communicate. 

It's easy to come down on the contractor and, believe me, I am with you. Contractors suck. Most of them have poor safety standards, poor pay, poor benefits, and are looking to save a buck at every turn. In fact, you can bet your ass that when the subcontractors heard about the problems, they were already trying to figure out how to capitalize on it. And most of them did. Which led to even more cost overruns. 

However, a joint venture the size of the one created to build this hospital wouldn't be dumb enough to pull this on purpose. The government is a good bed fellow when it comes to construction. If the contractor did anything that would compromise their position with the government on such a large and publicly known project, it would be absolutely nothing for the government to never deal with them again. 



Tldr
The VA has no business being in the construction business.  This is a massive project that only a handful of firms in the world could handle.  They've screwed themselves on this one and there is absolutely nothing to do other than bite the bullet and finish the job.

"&gt;[Air France 447 in 2009](http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta514.htm) and Malaysia 370 and the recent Germanwings A320 are in the news because they impact the airline industry, and the blame thus placed elsewhere. To date, pilot suicide, storms, and bad pilot judgement have been used, and how is the public to know otherwise? Electric trains such as the Disney Monorail  and [DC Metro crash](http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue142.htm) incidents in 2009 and the recent Amtrac 188 go into investigation while talking heads murmur about safety devices or track maintenance or mechanical failure, which ultimately get the blame.  

&gt;It is only when the public is broadly affected that the public can get a hint that something else is afoot. Cell phones are regularly having disrupted service but the blame is placed on blocked access to towers or bad weather. The [blackberry outage](http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta436.htm) in 2008 was blamed on a software glitch. If the public is frankly being lied to, engineers responsible for maintaining equipment and the grid are not fooled. The talk has spilled over into the press, or into conversations with the public. During the [Washington DC blackout,](http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue448.htm) the electrical problem was described at first by the Washington Post as a “surge”.

&gt;This is a key determinant between a failed electrical system, a simple outage, and electro-magnetic pulse. PULSE is a surge, and the sudden increase in the amount of magnetons and their associated electrons, such that equipment controlled by a steady pace of either particle flow goes into a runaway state. When equipment is guarded by surge protection, to guard against lightning strikes, it will shut down, as a brownout situation can damage equipment. But unless a lightning strike was present, there can be NO EXCUSE for a pulse or surge other than the presence of the charged tail of Planet X, aka Nibiru.  

&gt;What can the public expect? As cell phone service and cable TV via satellite continues to degrade, as airplanes increasingly crash during complete electronics failure or are forced to land with smoke in their cockpits, as electric trains surge off the tracks and brakes fail, as transformers explode at dams and on the grid, and as residential lights flicker and erratic and unexplained and spotty blackouts descend, the public can expect endless inane excuses from the establishment. The truth will be withheld because mankind is so dependent upon his electrical systems and equipment that the thought of being without is unthinkable. It is mass denial.

"A ton of pain your first time is not necessarily healthy, but it is common. You will need to wait until you are fully healed until you have sex again, and you might want to schedule a gyno appt depending on how badly you are bleeding or if you can see open tears in your vaginal opening.

When you do try again, it's extremely important to make sure you've had plenty of foreplay and that you are very wet and relaxed. Try using lube and/or stretching your vaginal opening with a few of his or your fingers before trying sex.

As for feeling used, it's okay that you feel that way but probably not okay to hold it against him unless you told him you were in pain or asked him to stop. Right now you are feeling used because something shitty and painful happened to your body, and he inadvertently got pleasure out of it. Remember that the idea that a woman's first time is supposed to hurt and involve blood has been around for a long time and is still common in our culture. Because of that, your boyfriend may not realize how badly things went wrong.

I think it's definitely okay to want to discuss it with him. Decide what you want to accomplish by talking to him about it and make sure you focus the conversation on that so he doesn't feel like you're asking him to help when he can't really do anything about the pain you're already in.
Try focusing on what you want your next time with him to look like. Maybe explain that you are still bleeding and having trouble getting out of bed. Tell him if you decide to see a doctor. Make it clear that this experience is neither healthy or okay to repeat.

"Focus on positive phrasing. He's your SO of a few years, talking about sex shouldn't be awkward.

What works with me and my SO is, whenever we try something new in the bedroom, a quick ""did you like when I did X with my Y?"" is enough for us to touch base and feel out what the other is thinking. Then we know if we should do it again next time and we are always up to date. Since you clearly have been lacking this constant communication in the bedroom, I personally would suggest having a full conversation about it instead of a ""show him during sex"" scenario. But it's a great way to maintain the flow of communication once you get your mojo back :)

So yes, remove yourself from the bedroom, have a glass of wine, sit close to him and hold his hand or touch him affectionately. Tell him what you like.

* It really turns me on when you go down on me. I especially would like it if you would nibble a bit on my inner thighs and my outer lips.  

* Next time we fuck, I want you to fuck me from behind and spank me, that will be *sooooo* hot!

* You have such a great body and I would really like to spend more time kissing and touching you before we have sex.

"I don't know much about some of the medications you mentioned, but I can offer some input about condoms. Lots of guys claim that condoms make sex not feel as good, and perhaps it does to an extent, but there's absolutely no reason why all of the weight needs to be on you, or any woman. Men need to man up and take some responsibility. I'm not trying to bash your boyfriend, and I'm not a feminist by any means, but it's something to be considered.

Also, even if he's on the larger side, there are plenty of condoms out there he can use. There have been funny little pictures and whatnot of people sticking standard sized condoms over their entire legs. Trust me, he can find a condom that fits. 

You're having trouble experiencing much pleasure during sex, and you're going way above and beyond trying to fix it, looking for the right birth control, seeing a therapist, all sorts of things. And your boyfriend wants to complain about a condom because *he* loses some sensation? No. That is not cool. 

I'm sorry to be so rash, but I see this type of problem way too often and it's really, really not fair for women. I hope you find a solution.

Also, this is your first partner. Try not to let your experiences with him rule the rest of your sexual life. All women are different, but none of us is alone.

"The title is very important IMO. It's the first impression an audience gets of your movie usually, and it's got to be catchy. It's a very short message that must convey three basics:

- A very basic idea of what it will be about

- Excitement and intrigue - it must be snappy and interest the viewer

- It has to work on more than one level with the themes of the story, so the viewer feels adequately rewarded for watching.

So Edge of Tomorrow was a perfectly fine title, since it gave you a sci-fi feel, it sounds dramatic and intriguing, and it can be interpreted more than one way with what's going on in the story (e.g., it's a time-travel tale, but also a battle for humanity's future). 

Having said that, ""All You Need is Kill"" would be fine too by that criteria, as well as ""Live. Die. Repeat."" The lesson here is it's not difficult to write a catchy title, but sometimes it's much more difficult for people to just make a simple decision and stick to it.

That the film improved on the flaws of the first one is bad? It is still an Avengers movie only that this time they don't have to spend 3/4ths of the movie to get them working together.

Ender`s game is easily one of my favorite books.

the movie is about the training of a kid to lead the forces of humanity against an alien race and after physical training he moves into ""virtual reality"" tactical simulation of big battles where ender leads the forces as a general and after the last battle in the game ""simulation"" is revealed that he was actually leading the battle with total disregard for the battle costs in lives wining in the end.

"It was OK, but not anything special. If you are a hardcore Nirvana fan like myself, aside from the home videos, there really isn't anything here that you didn't already know/seen. It's well-edited and does a good job of portraying Cobain's personality, but way too much of it relies on prior source material that we've seen before. They aren't kidding when they call this Montage of Heck, as this plays out a lot more like a 2.5 hour montage than an actual documentary. There are some animated sequences that are pretty cool and visually cool, but others get repetitive and feel straight up corny. The interviews are good, but they are very brief and make up little of the films running time. It also really doesn't focus on Cobain's work as an artist that made him so famous and skims over several very important events in his life. It instead focuses on what factors made him such a strange individual which really aren't that interesting. I also HATED where they decided to end it. By the end of it all, it almost felt like the whole thing was just an excuse to build up to the home video footage of him and Love which while interesting to see, is nothing fascinating. Considering all the hype built up around this, I couldn't help but walk away feeling disappointing considering this offered almost nothing new. Hardcore Nirvana fans will be disappointed for the same reason I previously stated and those who aren't too familiar with Cobain/Nirvana will walk away feeling like they barely learned anything about the subject other than the fact he was a really f'ed up guy and will probably be turned off by the serial style.

"I was honestly a bit disappointed with the movie as a whole. Dont get me wrong it was a fun movie, but even tough its 141 minutes long it felt ''short'', didnt it? 

It just felt like the pace was too fast and things didnt settle in, everything just sort of ''happend'' with no bit of explanation or any build up to it. I think the characters motivations werent well showed.

In conclusion, my tought was: 

Things done right:

- The action is just espectacular, even more when avengers fought as a team. The hulk x hulkbuster scene was great along with the first fight in the woods, in the beggining of the movie.

- Ultron personality was fun to watch, some funny comic bits and scenes.

- It was nice seeing captain more as a leader and kicking a lot more ass than in the first movie. I think its cool that you can really see him developing his skills through out the movies. 

- Hawkeye was really good in this movie, I liked that they showed he knows his place but still can make a huge difference in the team. I really liked his comic bits too, probably the funniest scenes in the movie have him involved.

- The end scene with the ''New Avengers'' was pretty cool, that felt really right.

- Vision was just spot on. Every single scene with him was just great!


Things gone wrong:

- The movie felt like it didnt add much to the storyline as a whole, I think that it should had focus more on explaining the power and importance of the infinity stones as a whole to the MCU, people that dont remember much of the previous movies or didnt watch them still have no clue/dont care what a infinity stone is. 

- For a movie called ''the AGE of Ultron'' it felt to me like Ultron was really easilly defeated and all the story in the movie felt like it happend way too fast. As I said before  things happened with no build up to it, they just ''happened''. I think the pacing in this movie in general wasnt so great, storywise.

- I missed a more manecing and dark Ultron. He felt more like a spoiled child than a dark enemy, he just didnt ''scare'' me at all. I tought he was really gonna give a tough time to some of the avengers, I felt like in NO moment I was at the edge of my seat thinking ''Holy shit, he's gonna kill him/her (add any of the avengers). I just never tought any of the Avengers where actually IN DANGER anytime through the entire movie. I felt that sometimes with Loki in the first movie (first fight with Cap, killing Coulson, almost killing Thor and stabbing him bad, almost killing Tony at the tower, etc)

- This bothered me so much: Tony puts the whole world in danger with his stupid ''I wanna be a mad scientist'' moment and by the end he has nothing to respond for? Even if no one actually acuse him of anything, he doesnt seem to care or take responsability for anything he did, by the end of the movie everyone is fine with what happend (even tough probably thousands of civilian lifes were taken) and the end felt like nothing really happened, that felt so cheesy and weird to me. It was the perfect situation to adress a struggle between Cap x Tony and maybe give a glimpse of what Civil War might feel and they just seem like best buds by the end of the movie. No one care about anything that happend!

- The romance between Natasha and Banner was really forced and out of place. It just happened out of nowhere and Natasha who was introduced as a cold hearted spy is now acting like a sentimental teenager. It just didnt work for me, it was just weird.

- Honestly Nick Fury has no place in this movie other than conveniently showing with a Hellicarrier by the end of it, one more example to me of things that just ''happen'' with no build up to it. I really like his character but it felt like he was just squeezed in this movie for the sake of it.

- I really didnt like Thor in this movie, he had such a high place in the first Avengers and now he just felt to me like a secondary character in this movie, the character really lacked emotion. And what the hell was that scene with Selvig, what was that lake that gave him a ''vision'' of things, what were his visions? Why he needed Selvig for with him? One more thing that just ''happend''

- So basically at the end of the movie it seems like Hawkeye and Ironman just dropped out of the Avengers? I think that was really unclear but it felt like they did. And if they did, shouldnt it feel like it was more of a big deal than what they showed? For me it just felt like ''So, Tony and Barton maybe are out, whatever, who cares''. It should be a big deal!

Well these are my toughts, fun movie with great action, but the story and character emotions felt a little flat to me. 7 ou of 10.

"Ja, actually compact hairs from Russian model Vladlena Svatekov

enabled the Darth Vader helmet prop to have functional design 

though still acting as a promotion for 2 businesses.

Frolovo modeling, a popular modelling agent in Russia, and 

Ulyanovsk barbers (a lesser known but reputable business) both 

encouraged the merging of companies together for profitability and 

later formed an agreement to advertise in the new block buster hit.

Cal Davies, an executive producer in Star Wars, agreed with this  

and skeptically allowed the new business to create Vader's helmet. 

Needless to say they nailed it and all producers and directors loved 

the design so much it was used in the actual films.

Much to many viewers surprise, the helmet is actually made of 

extremely well compressed, high quality hair strands which would 

let the crew in charge of making the helmet actually flex and work 

the fibers around molds and casts, giving much better accuracy.

Surprising, the way the hair fibers worked was they would be put 

through complex machinery in great bulk and compressed under 

enormous amounts of pressure, actually forcing the fibers and their 

enzymes to work together and created an artificial blanket in which 

layers and layers would be stacked to create a strong new material.

Basically, this new material worked in the same way as spider webs. 

Excessive amounts of it in bulk and the material becomes stronger 

and more durable than steel cable. Through compression, epoxy, 

material 'X' as they referred to it as, video editing, and paints, the 

skilled team were proud to have created the helmet of Darth Vader.

"Hey feel free to criticize/leave feedback. I don't know if this was enjoyable for anyone. 

Anyway, what do you guys think? Do you like the use of frames within frames here? Do you think it's a pretty limited tool (I did before seeing this film)? Are there any other films which employ them effectively?

***
**Edit:** Wow 35000 views. I think a lot of people didn't feel what I felt and so they viewed this negatively. Let me just reiterate that this was just my personal interpretation based on what I felt upon first watching this film. I wanted to share this because **in my opinion** this is good cinematography which has a point. There is very little analysis done on cinematography here, and I know some people like that content, so I thought I would share this. The few times when people do talk about cinematography here, they seem to confuse good cinematography with pretty pictures, but what point do pretty pictures serve by themselves? Would you honestly pay a DP to make the scenes of your thriller movie look prettier? Imo, good cinematography serves a purpose, and for me, this was an example of that. Some people are making this out to be an overly-analytical post, but for me, this is very superficial. I'm not looking at any hidden symbols/metaphors, I'm looking at what's on the screen and it how it immediately made me feel (which admittedly is a very subjective thing). If you don't feel anything, okay, perhaps watching the movie would give it more context, or perhaps you're just not into it, that's fine. I don't think you can say there's a wrong way of feeling. I mean, If you look at [this famous painting of a blue sky](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1280px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) and think, ""I would feel the exact same way if this sky was red"" then okay, nobody can argue with you, can they? But if it **does** make you feel something, then nobody can argue with you either, right?



Again, I thought I would make this because I hoped some people may enjoy it. The only analyses of films I see here are textual ones (""this plot is a metaphor for..."" ""this character represents"") and that stuff is great, but I often find conceits (which as the name implies, are conceited) uninteresting. I mean, if I watch a  movie, I **feel** something and to me, that's all that matters. **That** defines whether or not I enjoyed that movie. If it doesn't immediately make me feel something, which will happen with a conceited metaphor/symbol, then I personally don't care. Just as a recent example, there was a post which got several thousand upvotes which talked about how you are supposed to like the main character from the Wolf of Wall Street because Scorsese wants to show that the problem with society is not the existence of these villains, but rather the fact that we glorify/celebrate them/their lifestyles/mindsets. People loved the shit out of that, but again, I personally don't really care about that sort of stuff because when I was watching the Wolf of Wall Street I wasn't feeling guilty or hating myself for liking the main character. That conceit didn't make me feel anything, so what was its point? I personally don't really care about Scorsese's views on greed or capitalism, but again, that's just me.

So in other words, whilst I really like this sub and the community, I do sometimes wish there were different kinds of content. Now, the way I see it, I could either bitch about the fact that this sub doesn't have the content I want, or I could make that content myself and put it up here. I chose the latter. 


Finally, to all those saying this was unintentional, I personally disagree. Literally every time she has to ask for her job, there are barriers/frames. When the barriers are actually broken, (which happens 3 times in the film), they all lead to big actions. Nobody agrees to vote for Sandra unless the barrier between them is broken. To me, that's deliberate and intentional. ",false,false,t1_cr6qhp9,l_davies93,,0,1431449628,t5_2qh3s,t3_35q4fz,t3_35q4fz,24,1432916291,0,0,cr6qhp9,movies,24,,

"""right-to-work"" does not mean that. Right-to-work means that in a unionized shop, you can't be required to pay union dues, which makes it harder for unions to organize and stay funded properly. About half of the states have these laws on the books. Even in other states, you are not required to join the union, you are just required to pay dues because the union still has to spend money to represent you.  RTW basically is a way to hurt unions by creating a freeloader problem where those who pay dues, end up paying more and subsidizing those who don't which gradually weakens the unions. 

The phrase you are looking for is ""at-will"" employment. Which basically means that in the absence of a written employment contract (or union agreement) specifying otherwise, either party may terminate the contract at any time without cause.  So basically it is the default condition of employment in 49 of 50 states. Montana, I think is the outlier.

Android 5.1.x/5.2.x update pushed to all current Nexus devices (Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 9; no LTE on N7 2012 or N10) to enable compatibility with T-Mobile, Google Fi, Verizon, and AT&amp;T VoLTE/VoWi-Fi with seamless handoff, if possible in the baseband (Sprint can go screw themselves since they refuse to accept AMR-WB or VoLTE). VoLTE/Wi-Fi will no longer require extensive carrier modifications, bringing it more like Wi-Fi Calling on iOS 8 as opposed to the clunky mess T-Mobile has to go through now, or by skimping out and using Hangouts as a half-measure.

"Hey! I've seen you around and have to say, your comments always brighten my day. You're far too young to be my nana but at some point in the past I labeled you as 'cool grandma'. 

I have to say, I grew up with limits not *quite* so much on my reading but with very severe restrictions on my Internet use, the movies I watched, and the music I listened to. Not to mention that I had to stay 'pure' until marriage, and though I could've done something about that if I'd really tried, I managed. It worked out for me and my spouse but I am still dealing with the mental fallout of some aspects of my upbringing. 

My parents were admittedly trying to act in my best interest, but 'pure in mind as well as body' isn't really possible for a teenager to do when they aren't fully convinced it's a positive thing themselves. I constantly felt culturally left out. 

I had coded journals of all the (highly inaccurate) racy stuff I daydreamed about, and now after five years of marriage, I realize just how damaging my complete naievete was. And now that I've been married for a few years, thinking about the forbidden doesn't consume half of my existence. When I was 19, my mom somehow found a sex scene I had written on my computer- and weirdly enough, besides an argument about it, I think she was so embarrassed that there weren't really any repercussions. I think at that point she realized that I'd only be under their roof for so long and I was going to find out about this stuff one way or the other.

"It's rather a question of definition, in Sweden the police records all instances of suspected offence regardless how silly. That's why the ""sexual offene"" statistics include stuff like ""inappropriate staring"". Another factor is the gender equality, it has been linked to rising rape statistics, Norway and Denmark also has some pretty scary statistics compared to Italy or Greece but no serious criminologist actually believes women there are more exposed. There are tons statistical anomolies that drive the number up. It's all here in this study, here's the abstract:

&gt;Using Swedish rape statistics as a focus, this article aims to empirically describe the way in which different factors affect official crime statistics produced at the national level. It is argued that cross-national comparisons of crime levels are extremely hazardous when based on official crime statistics, since the construction rules vary widely. International comparisons of crime levels should as a rule be confined to findings of international victim surveys. The example of rape statistics in Sweden - about three times higher when compared to other countries in the European Sourcebook - is used to explain what factors can influence statistics. Statistical, legal and substansive factors are to be taken into account. The author shows that changes in statistical routines, the legal definition of rape and changes over time all influence the statistics in a substansive way. This article indicates the great extent to which crime statistics are a construct, whose appearance is very sensitive to the rules applied in the process of construction. In order to employ statistics appropriately, a thorough knowledge of the principles guiding this process is therefore essential.

"&gt;&gt;  Yeah, those damn atheist German terrorists again. /s

&gt; Yeah, [them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction). No /s necessary. The worst terrorism that ever actually hit Germany was very much made in Germany. Gudrun Ensslin was the daughter of a pastor, and Ulrike Meinhof had been a member of the protestant reform movement, but in general the RAF was a hard left, atheist group.

Difference between committing an act in the name of religion, and committing an act in the name of another ideology while incidentally also being religious (or atheist) at the same time. There's no such thing as atheist fundamentalism, atheist ideology, atheist dogma. The closest you can get is anti theism, which in extreme forms might seek to actively eradicate religion.

"&gt;The research we have shows that immigration has had a positive effect on economic growth in Europe overall. This remains true in economists' most sophisticated forecasts for the future. 

Bullshit, lies etc. Maybe he lumps European immigration with nonwestern immigration? That's a common trick to make it appear profitable. Another is to look at ""economic growth"" while 'forgetting' that the relevant statistic is *economic growth per capita*. But, I've documented on the past that (quoting myself here:

Norway:

The central bureau of statistics (roughly equivalent to the congressional budget office) calculated that the cost of each non western immigrant was 4,1 million NOK during their lifetime; equal to 665 000 USD. There are variations between the groups, with Somalis costing twice that. Reference: SSB Reports 15/2012, Makroøkonomi og offentlige fi nanser 
i ulike scenarioer for innvandring (Macro econmics and public finances in different immigration scenarios) http://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/rapp_201215/rapp_201215.pdf

In Denmark they were as in all things ahead of us, making the survey in 2008. More specifically, the central banks third quarterly report of 2008, noting that all immigration except for high skilled western ones were a massive loss. In 2005 this loss per immigrant was estimated to be negative 2,6 million DK, equal to 461 000 USD. Mind you, the inflation means the real value today is higher by 20% if the [online inflation calculator](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=100&amp;C1=DKK&amp;INDICE=DKCPI2013&amp;DD1=31&amp;MM1=01&amp;YYYY1=2006&amp;DD2=18&amp;MM2=08&amp;YYYY2=2014&amp;btnOK=Compute+actual+value) is to be believed. Source: [Report Velfærdskommmissionen March 2005 (The Welfare Commision) page 26.](http://www.fm.dk/db/filarkiv/18669/Rapport_globalisering.pdf)

In Sweden? Well, statistics like this would get you exiled pretty quickly. But we do know that, according to the central bureau of statistics in Sweden - Statistiska Centralbyrån or SCB - 57% if ""foreign born"" immigrants age 21-61 work, whereas 87% is the number for natives. For Africans the number is 39/48 for women/men, for Asians (mid easterners realistically) it's 46/54. Source: [Statistiska Centralbyrån Integration: Rapport 6](http://www.scb.se/Statistik/_Publikationer/LE0105_2013A01_BR_BE57BR1301.pdf) So there's no reason to think the expense is any lesser in Sweden than in other countries.

I could go on and on and on. The main problem is low labour participation rates, with a secondary problem of little higher education in the second generation. I have yet to see anywhere this doesn't hold true. 
Also, mind you, that in Norway atm the unemployment rate looks like [this](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:no&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false) and an economy per capita of twice that of Germany and France. Free school, university, highly subsidized childcare. In other words, ideal conditions. If it doesn't work here, how do you think immigration works in countries with 6+% unemployment?

The fact is, if you *actually care* about helping people, you should advocate spending money in their home countries because god knows how many africans you could save for 500k$. Certainly more than the one you can save through immigration - and it ends up being more than 500k a piece too, once they start bringing their family members in. 

----------------

Honestly I'd be surprised if the numbers weren't even worse in the UK.

[Some attempts at making calculations have been made](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/Immigration-from-outside-Europe-cost-120-billion.html) and they show that immigration cost 120 billion £. Of course, it will be much worse once these grow old and their labour participation rate plummets (further). This is another common trick to make immigration look profitable: You count the incomes without adjusting for age. Immigrants tend to be younger, and thus get less pensions. Of course, this doesn't last... Immigrants will eventually age.


All of the above calculations are optimistic estimates, as they assume the children of immigrants are integrated 100% and won't incur additional costs. They also don't take into account that in many cultures second generation immigrants will bring spouses from their old country, thus incurring additional costs.

"Jews controlled the ICTS security firm at the airports. They controlled the WTC complex. They controlled the DOJ. Mossad infiltrated CERT with Mr. Yoran.

The point I am illustrating here is that you cannot really talk about how 9/11 was done without tripping over Jews.

We already know who was involved. They are not hidden.

In this article, the author, Anne Elizabeth Powell, describes in detail how civil engineers quickly mobilized and led the efforts to evaluate not only the performance of the structures involved in the two assaults but also the vulnerability of the nation's infrastructure to future attacks in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon:

Meanwhile, all the *live* witnesses failed to see and/or hear (!) a plane, and the supposed aluminum planes didn't crash into the steel-column building but were swallowed entirely, and detonated once inside.

They escaped but many did not. Most of the prisoners later were there because they either tried to escape Vietnam to the west. The worst part was that the new government turned people against eachother as family friends killed each other to prevent further abuse. The people who had most to lose from the war were not the Americans nor the French but the natives of Vietnam.

The Nazis had a few long range bombers - but high command was more interested in short and medium range bombers after the events of the Spanish Civil War. Also, dive bombing. One of the requirements for a German bomber was that it was able to dive. As you can imagine, this was difficult for a heavy bomber to accomplish.

IMO Hitler failed in Russia because OKH was too detached from the situation on the front.

Season to taste, I like to use pickled jalapeno, fresh garlic, onion powder, ground pepper, cumin and a little bit of chilli powder for seasoning. I add a pinch or two of sea salt at the end, don't add it until the end as it will stop the beans from softening if added before cooking. You can also control the thickness of the beans by saving the liquid you cook them in to mix in during the mashing process. Combine with seasoned ground turkey or chicken, and a mixture of fat free cottage cheese and fresh garden salsa(sounds gross, I know, but it's actually really good) to top it off. I'll add things depending on what I have on hand at the time, like mixed greens or avocado, and always sriracha. That on a wheat tortilla is one of my go to bulk and healthy staples.

"I didn't discuss the article nor did I discuss what mathematicians do. So what in the world are you talking about? I talked about OP's question and what mathematics IS.

Perhaps YOU didn't understand the article, or don't understand the foundations of mathematics.

&gt;But it's also used as a foundation for most of the work done in various branches of the field.

True and irrelevant to OP's misguided question which I was just trying to re-guide.

It may be used as a foundation for *doing* a *type* of mathematics, but mathematics nonetheless is not based in this theory. It is in fact the other way 'round.

As I've said set theory and type theory are subsets of mathematical logic which are subsets of mathematics.

&gt;Set theory provides a method of writing proofs in a wide variety of areas, and it's quite normal for advanced classes in analysis, algebra, geometry, etc. to begin by establishing the basics of set theory as they are used in that field.

Again, true and irrelevant to OP's misguided question, and I simply restate what I said earlier about foundations, and as I read the rest of your comment I see that this response holds with respect to all of your points.

"&gt;You are very rude, but I'll give it one last shot. 

Hard not to be when you have ignorance personified telling you that your ideology is akin to Bolsheviks when there's really no comparison to be had(save the impertinent inverse correlation to liberty and collectivism you recited). 

&gt;Of course there's no fundamental reason society could not provide education and healthcare without the state. But that is irrelevant. **The argument in favour of state education is that it is fair and just to provide these things universally, not that this is the only way of providing these services.** The alternative to state-sponsored education and state-assisted healthcare is a level of inequality that I consider undesirable. 

&gt;You are simply wrong on your second point. A principle can be correct even if its application is inadequate in a given case. Take the failings of the US public school system: it's not the principle of universal education that causes the schools to fail, but wider social factors, including, remarkably enough, the existence of the private school sector.

Except the principle IS the application.  The principle is that federal money improves schooling.  A principle that is a sham by all metrics.

"As a person with narcolepsy this is the beginning to one of my biggest fears. The end of the nightmare involves me hitting and killing a family. 

As a result I miss out on a decent amount of things in life because I won't drive unless I'm sure I won't fall asleep.

Edit: since a lot of people don't understand narcolepsy (which isn't their fault).

Yes you can drive with narcolepsy. There are different kinds of narcolepsy and ranges of severity. The treatments are decent (for some people) and you can regain a somewhat normal life sometimes. Cataplexy (the sudden falling asleep and muscle weakness) is the main danger and not everyone has this. 

My doctors (you know those people that know me and my condition) agree that I should and encourage to drive when I believe I'm able. I have had this condition for over 10 years so I have a really good idea about my limits and I'm overly cautious. I'm on every medication possible (Nuvigil, addrrall and xyrem) at the highest doses i can tolerate. And have even designed (its not complete yet) an app that tracks if my eyes are open or closed and the angle of my head tilt to wake me up in the event I do doze off (which has never happed) using Google Glass, a smart phone and Bluetooth car speakers. 

People have fears that aren't always justified (like people with spiders) but they are fears no the less. People are much more likely to have heart attacks, tire blowouts and freak mechanical failures than I me falling asleep. Even so I take every precautions I can, I don't drive when I'm emotional (which can be a trigger), I'm never in a rush and always leave way early, I use GPS everywhere so I don't have to think about directions and I generally don't take trips longer than an hour unless I have a passenger (again my doctors want me to drive). 

I apologize for not explaining this earlier because I often forget that people assume that all narcolepsy is like what you see in the media.

"~~I beg you pardon? Exactly how is motivation a tangible, physical thing? 'I'll have one motivation please'.~~ welp, totally missed that. Maybe I shouldn't comment 5 minutes after I wake up.

But seriously , we humans always like to describe complex things like motivation and consciousness, but why do we keep forgetting that these things don't exist. Not literally, not physically. Consciousness for example is a compound process of many individual parts working together, something like that can't be described in one 3-5 word sentence. \* If we want to really figure out things like consciousness and motivation, we should study them like we do everything else, and not approach them as if they are some magical force that can't be described with all our conventional tools. I'm not saying we don't, but a lot of our current 'research' is basically just useless pseudostudies and metastudies.

"There I was.

No shit, there I was. 

I saw a kid who had run out of gas try to buy some from a gas station attendant to put into a *styrofoam* [drink cup.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QFHNYk2bJWE/TeQCwtgVwHI/AAAAAAAAAKU/iWCNPIa5Lc0/s400/cup.jpg) Kid got pissed when the clerk wouldn't sell. Kid didn't believe me when I said it was because gas melts styrofoam. 

Kid went outside and asked customers who had paid at the pump if he could buy some of their gas. (People mostly pump their own in my state.)

I had nothing better to do but hang around to see if the clerk would notice and run him off before the kid found someone dumb enough to agree to his plan.

The kid found some lady who took him up on his idea.  (Yes, now I realize I should have intervened but I was a very different person then.)

She sticks the nozzle down into the cup and squeezes the pump handle fully. Gas instantly sprays everywhere.  Mostly right back into the lady's face and torso. Fully drenches the lady. The lady jerks the nozzle back but doesn't release the pump handle right away. The kid gets showered with more gas. Both start screaming variations on ""It's in my eyes! I can't see!""

Two seconds later the cup starts melting. Like aggressively melting. The kid tries to scrape it off his hand and arm but it's sticky. Now he's dancing around and flinging little blobs of chemically melted styrofoam all over the filling area.

The lady is just standing there in shock. Dripping like she just got out of the shower but it's gas.  Other customers and their vehicles are getting pelted with these birdshit-seeming gas-reeking turdlets. They are not happy to say the least. 

Clerk comes barreling out of the store, livid. 

""WHAT THE FUCK DID I SAY? THAT'S NOT AN APPROVED CONTAINER FOR GAS!""  Clerk just keeps repeating himself as he hauls out the garden hose and attempts to rinse off the lady, the kid, and the other customers.

Police, firetruck and ambulances arrive. Cops trying not laugh while explaining to the kid that he now has a court date after he gets checked out at the hospital. Kid is very subdued. At least he has the sense to be embarrassed. 

Cops also issue a ticket to the other half of this brain trust as she's being looked after by the EMT's at the back of an ambulance. Now she's livid. Looks like she's about to rip up the summons and throw it at the cops. Screams ""what do you mean it's against the law?"" ""It was his idea!""  She eventually collects herself and signs the ticket.

True story.

"So you have sugar, you have soluble carbs, and you have insoluble carbs (fiber). You also have proteins and fats (and other trace stuff we won't worry about.) Everyone eats some mix of these things. Eggs are protein and fat, cheese is fat and protein, broccoli is fiber and soluble carbs, carrots are soluble carbs and fiber and sugar, apples are insoluble carbs and sugar, meat is protein and fat, bread is soluble carbs and fiber (and quite often these days a significant amount of sugar too), nuts are fat and soluble carbs and fiber, milk is fat and sugar, etc, etc. Everything is made up of some combination of other stuff. 

Note that anything with an ""ose"" on the end of it is a sugar. Lactose, sucrose, dextrose, fructose - all sugars. Hence milk having sugar in the form of lactose. 

Keto removes the sugar and the soluble carbs as much as possible. So no breads, no candy, no pasta, etc. Basically when you're eating to induce ketosis in your body, you want to trigger a switch from burning sugar for fuel to burning fat for fuel. This eliminates blood sugar spikes. It was originally designed in the early 1900's to eliminate epilepsy in kids who were resistant to all other epilepsy drugs, and it was wildly successful, but never caught on for a lot of reasons. 

When you ""eat keto"" (eat to induce and maintain ketosis), your diet is mostly meat, fish, eggs, cheese, a little bit of nuts and a lot of green veggies. Your stool (aka poo) changes because input directly impacts output in almost every system - your bowels aren't having to deal with sugar and carbs anymore; proteins and fats solidify into a much denser mass. Constipation can become a real issue and fiber supplements are often a good idea in addition to all the green veggies, which provide a bit of fiber too. 

It's actually a very good diet for people who regularly get diarrhea or loose stools. Also for type 2 diabetics, folks with specific sorts of IBS, folks with gluten intolerance (no wheat), obese people, women with PCOS and a bunch of other issues and conditions which are more niche. I've heard mixed reviews of using it for folks with chemical imbalances in their brains - because burning ketones for fuel does change brain behaviour it can make things a lot better or a lot worse, depending. It can also have drug interactions which need to be monitored. It's not really good for folks with serious preexisting kidney problems, since it does place a heavy workload on the kidneys - one of the things folks in keto need to be aware of is to drink more water than the average joe, otherwise they can get kidney stones a lot easier. There's a supplement which can fix that, though. And honestly, kidney stones are far more treatable than coronary heart disease or bowel surgery.

"&gt;For a nation this size, 15 ships plus the AOPS vessels plus the Kingston-class is still deficient

Why, exactly? Despite having a large coastline, we really don't have any enemies to defend it against, do not have much in the way of smuggling to worry about, and have the most powerful country in the world as our neighbour and ally.

&gt;The technology of 2040 will be so different from that of 2020 that it's ridiculous that all of these ships will be identical. Their capabilities will be quite different, likely even after the refit of older models

I am not sure what your point is. There's nothing to say that the ships will be exactly the same, even if they have the same basic layout. This might surprise you, but there are plenty of countries that build large ship classes like this one over more than two decades. Look at the Arleigh Burke class in the USN: first ship launched in 1989, most recent ship launched **last month**. Do you not think improvements were made to systems along the way, or do you think the USS John Finn is the same ship as the USS Arleigh Burke?

&gt;We not only have to pay to build these ships, but to completely rebuild Canada's warship-building industry and associated infrastructure.

Definitely a risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one?

&gt;If we wait another 20-30 years to build more ships after this contract is up, this 'investment' will be completely squandered.

This is the most salient point you have made, and definitely one that needs to be considered. For the investment being made, one needs to have long term strategic thinking. The new SSC will have to start being replaced about 30 years after the first vessel enters commission, so probably 5-10 years after the last vessel is commissioned, if the entire program takes 20 years (more likely 25) to make all 15 ships. What the RCN needs to do is find a way to utilize those yards in that 5-15 year downtime. Can they? Can the government afford to? I don't know. The most likely solution would be a replacement for the actic patrol vessels at that time, providing a bridge between the completion of the SSC program and the followup.

&gt;The promise of 'Canadian jobs' building these things has cost us a lot of money. As someone who drives past the new shipyard daily and stands to indirectly benefit from the economic influx of this largesse, I still think we should have contracted vessels with countries that actually still build them rather than trying to restart a long-dead industry.

It's a lot more complicated than that. What provides more value to the Canadian government, building a $2B ship in Canada, or buying a $1B ship from France or Germany? On the surface it looks like the later, but if the government recovers $1B in taxes from the $2B investment (a very real possibility) then the actual cost is a wash, but the economy of Canada grows from the former.

"All the suggestions here are what I would call ""the hard way"" - you will have to get dirty, but angle grinders and wire brushes and elbow grease will take days, and the curve on that super awesome teapot will be nearly impossible.

I LOVE taking the rust off of things - every piece of cast iron in the house is salvaged this way, so I'ma tell you the easy way to do it, and when you do your research, you'll find others suggest the same  thing.

Vinegar.  Go to the grocery store, pick up a few gallons of vinegar for a dollar and a half each.  get a big 'ole bucket that can hold things, or at least one at a time since they're so big - and soak those bad-boys in vinegar for a day and a half.  the rust will sludge right off with a wire brush - minimal elbow grease.  then rinse, *immediately* dry (I will put things right on the stove after paper-towel dry) and an immediate coating of peanut oil.

Those are great finds, and completely salvageable.

Good luck, feel free to ask me any questions you might have - it's super simple and basic.  Wear old clothes when you do the de-sludging, it can get everywhere.

It is not just wise, but a waste of time.

Edit: I will explain a little better.

Dating implies one of two things. If I missed something, please correct me.

1. There is a long term commitment, with marriage as the goal
2. You are being physically intimate (from kissing to sex), which is often looked down upon to various degrees in religious circles

"This was only posted here to make Christians look bad, as is 50% of the stuff posted in this forum. The gist of it is that Christians have blood on their hands because they frown upon people seeking treatment. 

The truth is that psychology is a pseudoscience. As someone who has suffered from mental illness, I went to see psychologists and shrinks. I did exactly as I was supposed to. I was given drugs that did more harm than good. And there are many like me. Untold numbers of people commit suicide and harm others after taking antidepressants. Almost every single school-shooter was being treated by a shrink and on anti-depressants. You can hardly name one who wasn't.

The fact is that they are working off the wrong template of man. They don't understand man. And the drugs are barely better than a placebo. Almost everyone who has a positive testimony from taking these drugs would have had the same testimony if you had given them sugar pills.

People have a right to be wary of the whole profession. When I was in college, from what I saw, the brightest minds were taking math and science, while those who couldn't hack the material settled for psychology. 

Even worse are the multitudes of studies that liberals quote as if they were chapter and verse. Most of these are prepared by students, and when reproducibility tests had been attempted, astonishing figures play out-- whereby 60% or higher could not be reproduced. Think about that the next time a liberal atheist posts a psychology study in this sub. 

What they don't tell you is that there is a Christian drug and alcohol treatment center in Texas that is pulling off 70% cure rates, compared to secular cure rates, which are under 10%.

The title is completely misleading and wrong. What they've done is removed the non-commercial license, and changed it to something else, probably GPL. ""Open Source"" just means that your source code is freely available, not that you are using GPL or any other kind of license. Defining it as just GPL is pretty stupid. They've been talking about changing the license for some time so this is no surprize.

After his heart to heart with Krazy 8, Walt goes up to get the key to let him go, believing that he won't hurt him or his family.  Walt, while in the kitchen, decides to puzzle the plate pieces back together to notice a shard is missing.

"I wish Ryan Murphy had stepped down as showrunner on Glee. He has good ideas and his shows start out well, but they all spiral when it comes to the point where he obviously has no ideas left. Season 1 was perfect, that first half where they weren't sure if they would be picked up again would go down as a classic part of television history if it had been cancelled then, but you could tell immediately when it came back that something was different. Season 2 had obviously had the Fox execs involved, realising how big of a cash cow the show could be and making every song in that first episode a top 40 pop hit. The season was good but not great, and the show just kept downgrading until it became the piece of shit it was in the end. And I blame Ryan Murphy for that.

"I binge watched it in 3 days about 2 weeks ago. It's so addicting and the premise is indeed amazing.

The show definitely has a lot of flaws but I think overall it is more than good enough to keep you entertained throughout.

It starts out a lot like a teen drama, including pop music in the soundtrack, that only lasts a short time though. It grows up very quickly and focuses a lot on the blurred line between good and bad and the justification for doing awful things if the intention is good.

As for the gay/lesbian aspect well the main character does indeed kiss a girl. The girl she kisses mentions a special girl in her life previously and it's talked about just like any other relationship - there is no positivity or negativity attached specifically to it being a lesbian love, which I personally think is a good thing.

I can't recommend the show highly enough. It's been renewed for a third season coming early next year.

"&gt;Conservatives don't hate black people.

I agree, just like Liberals don't hate white people.

&gt;The west needn't apologize for its past. Without the great imperial ambitions of Europe, the world would be much poorer. 

That is pure speculation, history would have taken a much different turn had Europe stayed to itself.

&gt;Liberals treat the west as the source of all evil, not the producer of the same concept of liberties and rights they claim to represent.

Liberals like to remember that these lofty ideals of western society were often ignored or reserved for a select portion of the populace, usually Christian white males. Religious tolerance may have started in greece, but religious persecutions in the west seem just as common as anywhere else in history. 

&gt; So why don't whites also get the credit for ending slavery?

"Thanks for sharing this.  This clears up a lot of questions I had but have been too busy/lazy to find answers for.  I backed them for 3 months.  A few weeks ago when my first shipment arrived I was excited.  The hand written message was a nice touch.  Then I looked at what they had sent me.  I picked the vibe #work.  The first record was Busta Rhymes' ""The Big Bang"".  I'll put aside the fact that, while I'm a hip hop fan, I have precisely 3 hip hop records in my Discogs list.  As far as my record collection goes, it skews almost entirely to rock or electronic.  So besides clearly not using discogs as a meaningful data point, who in their fucking right mind would pick a Busta Rhymes record as background music for trying to concentrate on heads down work?  Seriously.  That's the dumbest selection ever.  I also received Def Leppard and Rod Stewart.  I have neither, nor anything remotely similar, listed in my discogs collection.  Also, it's worth noting that the Busta Rhymes records are so warped that they are literally unplayable.  After the initial shock of disappointment when seeing what they ""hand curated"" and subsequent disappointment after I try to listen to an unplayable record, I immediately wondered how I send them back.  Now I know.  I don't.   If I'm ever near their brick and mortar store I'm going to literally leave the records at their front door, possibly accompanied by a hand-curated turd.

"It will probably take less than a year to feel out of your fog tbh, but that doesn't mean you should just start doing drugs again right when you feel better. I think you should definitely stop drugs until you feel 100% normal again, then decide if its okay for you to start using drugs REACREATIONALLY again -- not every day, maybe not even every weekend. Every once in a while, which is how you get their best effects.

I once tripped on 25i three times in one month, and it put me in such a state of depression and derealization that I seriously didn't know what to do. That shit lasted for the shorter end of a year, I am so fucking thankful its gone now.

You might also consider therapy, as talking about how you feel could help it.

Honestly, after you take your break and feel better, you might not even feel like doing drugs again so don't force yourself to for the sake of doing it. And for the sake of your break, do not do ANY drug EVER. That very much includes alcohol and adderall, because I know firsthand both of those are addictive as fuck from the first time you do them.

But your brain is definitely not fucked, even if its a long road to recovery your brain is amazingly flexible and will certainly heal in time.

"I have always considered racism to be classification based on race. The case that an individuals applicability to something is determined by race. Thus it is a ""race"" - ""ism"". I don't think that the word implies that it must be associated with inferiority or superiority.  Thus I do not agree with the above definition.

Since the current belief is that determining an individuals applicability to something based on race which is a broad set of variables, which  are also broadly variable it is generally accepted that determining a individuals attributes based on race is bad and ineffective. The key here being that because they are ineffective it leads to unfairly categorizing an individual, when the use of individual information would be more accurate.

Thus, in reference to Enigmutt ""exclusionary "", it could be racism in the sense that a rental advert for ""indians only"" is exclusionary and unfair to other races in the same that if all rentals in Sydney listed ""whites only"".  It is potentially negatively racist in the sense that if you saw a advert advertised as ""white"" playgroup would imply that others are not welcome based on race.

I do tend to think its a bit more complicated in that what defines a groups ability to maintain culture, white, Indian or otherwise. One asks is this negatively racist? Perhaps but it certainly isn't black and white. Singapore which maintains the worlds most diverse ethnic group of people has laws which we would consider discriminatory such as requiring people to have race on identity cards.

"Has to be interpreted with some caution. PPP as a measure is better than just looking at nominal wages. However, the tax structure in Ireland places a higher burden on the lowest paid as while we have a relatively progressive income tax structure, we also have a whole bunch of regressive ""stealth"" taxes that disproportionately hurt the lowest decile. 

There's also the fact that in many of the countries we're being compared to, your basket of goods is different. For example some have subsidised childcare, free textbooks, and healthcare that's free at the point of access.

Finally there's the fact that our minimum wage applies only to ""experienced adult workers"", which means that lots of those aged 18-21 aren't actually getting the minimum wage, but a lower amount.

"What makes enslaving a person wrong? It hurts your feelings? Hurting your feelings does not make something intrinsically wrong. So I have nothing to explain or justify to begin with. But the more salient point that you missed was that you are making a **category error** by using the word ""slavery"" interchangeably between those two distinct contexts, when, in reality, the meaning of the word is completely altered from the former context to the latter context.

White European slavery was not analogous to the slavery that the Islamic caliphates, such as the Ottomans, practiced, and the type of slavery that is allowed by Islam. It was only analogous to the Southern Arabian slave traders (Yemenis) who enslaved plenty of sub-Saharan people for no justifiable reason (abducting them). That was what Europeans did and that is haram. 

The only slavery allowed in Islam is that under the context of total war. And as I explained elsewhere in the thread, it's nothing unreasonable at all. And despite all of this, the Qur'an, in its immense benevolence, still exhorts Muslims who pay the ransom price of freeing slaves for the sake of God. And Muslims have done this for a long time. Even Saladin did it himself when he liberated Jerusalem.

The only reason people on this website hate him is because he defies their political framework of the world -- he uses Islamic rhetoric and he gives no heed to the blamers -- and he heavily invests himself into positioning Turkiye into a position of solidarity with basically the rest of the Muslim countries -- at expense of his relations with disgusting regimes like the Zionist one.

"**Heckler and Koch Mark 23**

This is my most recent aquisition. This gun is really fun. It's comically large, but is actually pretty comfortable in the hand and nice to shoot. The size makes the recoil feel very soft, and the long sight radius makes it easy to shoot accurately. The single action trigger is very good. Not like a 1911 good, but it's great for what it is. The break is crisp and the reset is short. The double action pull is approximately the weight of a family sedan, but it's relatively smooth.

The Mark 23 can be carried cocked and locked, or hammer down with the safety off. The safety cannot be engaged with the hammer down, and the decocking lever cannot be used with the safety on. 

**Size**

Like I said, this gun is really big. [Here are some photos comparing it to some other handguns](http://imgur.com/a/Gkufi).

This gun would be essentially impossible to conceal, but that's obvious. For everything else, the size kind of works to the gun's advantage. It's big, but the grip is nice and the gun doesn't feel huge when you're shooting it. The long sight radius is something else, and helps a lot with accuracy.

**Parts**

[Here are the major parts of the gun after field stripping](http://imgur.com/a/zRqJT).

The parts seem to be really high quality, and all of them fit together surprisingly tight. The slide is very snug on the frame and the barrel is almost as tight as my Les Baer when the gun locks into battery. I would think this tight fit was intentional to improve the gun's mechanical accuracy.

**Fun Facts**

This gun and its history are pretty interesting. There is some great information about it in the owner's manual, which I thought was pretty cool for HK to include. [Here are some interesting pages from the manual](http://imgur.com/a/bQohV).

Some highlights:

* The gun was designed in 1991
* All the guns tested (450) shot &lt;2.5"" 5-shot groups at 25 meters, and the average was 1.44""
* The guns were required to fire 30,000 rounds of +P ammo without breaking any parts
* During testing of the guns, the minimum mean rounds between stoppages was &gt;6,000, and the maximum was &gt;15,000
* After 30,000 rounds the guns were testing for accuracy again, and still achieved the required &lt;2.5"" groups at 25 meters
* The o-ring on the barrel lasts &gt;20,000 rounds
* This was the first .45 Auto handgun to enter US military service since the M1911A1

**tl;dr**

This gun is really fun to shoot and has a pretty interesting history. You should shoot one if you ever get the chance.

When you can tell the slide is going to slip back with just the hint of lug contact and a few soft clicks, and magazines will positively lock in, but the mag well has been dented and smoothed out on one side so many times they'll float in and drop free, and the slide release is going to respond to your thumb's definitive touch almost instantly and the feed ramps will have a mirrored sheen. It's going to chamber a round alright. It's had thousands of factory and reloads seated. The headspace is perfect.

"First up this is a small run project where all three of the items that i ran have been spoken for. It is a real muzzle device, if it functions like a true muzzle brake has yet to be determined. Trials will start probably tomorrow which i can report back if people want to know. I have no idea if this thing is going to be 100% safe or not. I have talked to a couple builder friends who think it should function without any issues, but i have my concerns hahaha. 

A year ago i made a career shift due to lack of telecom/it work in my area. I started a cnc machining program and have goals to purchase my own machine (probably a 4 axis mill) in the next two years time. I have my class III as well as base ffl, if this goes as planned i'll look to change to a builders license. This was one of my final projects that i ran for myself at the end of class (tomorrow is my final day of school). 

This brake was an interesting idea that came out of a joke between a friend of mine and myself. We both joked around about the idea, and i said to hell with it and started to mess with some 3D models. This is what i came up with. I took the models, put them into cam software and programmed out my parts. This is a highly limited run due to time as well as funds. I can't see throwing money at a what if right now. If things were more stable in my life perhaps, but currently i can not. If you have interest in buying one i'm sorry to burst your bubble. Perhaps down the line a few years time i'll produce them if i feel demand is right. As for now it'll live on as a joke item that may or may not function as intended ahhahaha. 
A friend of mine and i plan on trying to get some kind of slow motion video to see if we can get some ""fuck flames"" to come out the ports although i doubt we'll get anything of that sort ahhaha. 

Dimensions: 4.5"" long, 1.490 diameter (so i can get away with 1.5"" stock), 1.1"" bore, 22x0.75 metric threads, 0.8"" lock nut, 1"" flats for a wrench, steel construction (believe it's 1018, but not positive, the stock room at school is a mess)

It also will be coated in something (cerakote, etc) after testing.

"R&gt;Two decades ago, my father bought a Muzzelite stock kit for his Mini-14 and let it sit in his garage until it was rediscovered last month. The Muzzelite was made iconic by 90s cinema, being used in such classics as *Starship Troopers* and the good version of *Total Recall*. As a rifle, however, its pretty awful. The trigger is especially heavy, the sights are way over the bore and the overall quality feels like a Fisher-Price toy thats been left in the sun for too long. But that’s okay. The purpose of the Muzzelite was never practical; it was designed to make a cheap rifle look cool with a cheap accessory. It’s early 90’s tactic cool, ephemera from a bygone age, like the original Gameboy or boy bands. It seemed cool at the time, but with the benefit of hindsight, it’s pretty terrible.

You and I will never agree politically, I will debate issues with you because you seem like someone who knows what they talk about, there are sound arguments from all parties it's all personal preference. Everyone should be able to support who ever they like without any fear of intimidation.

I wanted to like polygon because I was fond of mcwhertor and crecente when Kotaku was in its hayday and pleasant to read. I was hoping they would bring that to polygon but polygon kept getting worse and worse. The last straw for me was their review of dota 2 and how they had to lie about things to make the game seem misogynistic. The reviewer had apparently spent months playing the game but still said that women in the game were relegated to mages and supports which is ridiculous. The majority of female characters in the game are carries. He also complained that when the crystal maiden died her clothes would disappear leaving her scantily clad even though she just loses her hair and it had been a known bug in the game for a year or so.

Not completely an API limit since you can always throw more CPU power against it, but yeah DX11 needs allot of CPU power to process draw calls. AMD proofed this with Mantle, leading to MS announcing DX12 and Nvidia optimizing their DX 10/11 driver. AMD this far refused to do the same optimizations and instead waits for DX12 or that developer use Mantle.

The game is optimized to platforms that don't have that big of a draw call problem.

&gt; If an OC'd 5960X can't provide enough draw calls for any GPU, from anyone, IMHO it's a software problem.

&gt;Soon you'll see Black Mesa available on Steam for a relatively low price. But we aren't dropping all support for the free version. In fact shortly after the Steam release there will be a completely new free version of the game. We also plan to open source our maps and some game assets to the modding community!

&gt;Purchasing the Steam version of Black Mesa is more about supporting the team and our efforts than anything else. However, the Steam version will include features that the free version simply can not have.

So, I suppose that the main reasons to buy the Steam version (besides supporting the devs for their awesome work) would be things like Workshop support, trading cards, and other Steam community stuff.",false,false,t1_cqxku8j,CantUseApostrophes,,0,1430708259,t5_2qhfg,t3_34s4as,t1_cqxk8xs,40,1432756949,0,0,cqxku8j,pcgaming,40,,

"Basically you're seeing a kind of ""Diminishing returns"".

Look at the advance of graphics over the years. Starting with pong, then 8-bit, then the first 3D games, etc. At first the differences were huge from generation to generation, and very noticeable.

Now, as graphics technology continues, the differences you can readily see are going to get smaller. However, those differences are still costly in the computation department.

This is the same reason that you can run into individual settings in modern games that are ""frame rate killers"". For example shadows on ""high"" might run great, but on ""ultra"" it might drop you to 40 FPS. Something that doesn't increase image quality a lot can still take a lot more calculations in the background.

The latest and greatest games/graphical settings will always give you the least bang for your buck in the computation department.

One way you can see this in action, try setting a very recent game to low settings. Most should run (and look) fairly similar to how Crysis does on high settings the same hardware.

"No, it's very different.  Mortgages are collateralized by home values, which fell sharply in 2008 - when people walked away from them, banks were left with assets worth less than the value of the money lent out, and these losses caused bankruptcies.  What was critical was that borrowers in many states had the option to walk away from the asset (the home) and owe nothing further, aside from the damage to their credit score.

Student loans, however, are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, so under current law, the borrower is still on the hook even if their education turns out to be worth less than they hoped.  They still have to pay - if not in the short term, then in the long-term through having either tax refunds or eventual social security docked.

"No, this kind of behavior out of retailers is what's wrong. You don't choose who you sell to. Unless someone legitimately came in ahead of time and asked for one to be reserved and maybe even put a few bucks down ahead of time to secure it, nobody should be allowed to restrict sale. Someone comes in, has the cash or a valid credit card, *you sell it to them*. There's no speculation as to whether this customer ""deserves it"". That's a big reason there's this disdain from the non craft drinkers about craft beer. It's not as much the snootiness of what crazy flavor beer you're drinking, it's that you have to be all high and mighty when someone deems you worthy of buying a (usually intentionally) ultra rare beer.

"Hey there! Im a pet owner, and a vet tech, so I 100% know where you're coming from. And I saw your post on r/vet, too but I think the vet there covers everything I was thinking. I have a few things I think you should hear. 1) if you're not comfortable with the last vet you went to, go back to the first one. Immediately. Cost should not factor into your decision. I know pet care is expensive, but its worth every penny for our fur babies. 2) Z/D, while expensive, is a very good food. Hill's does a lot of food trials, and while not everyone loves Z/D, its a bland diet that helps often with stomach issues. That being said, I don't think chicken and rice will help since its just another bland diet. 3) The next step is diagnostics. No vet is going to be able to fix anything without knowing what's going on inside your buddy's body. It's hard with pets .. they can't tell us what's wrong, so we need lab work and radiographs and ultrasounds to show us what's wrong. It's expensive, but the alternative is that your pup, whom you clearly love, vomits after every meal. How would you feel if that were you? 4) Care credit stinks, but it sounds like its your best option. Please go back to your vet  and listen to what they say. They're not in it for the money, they're not trying to take your money, they're trying to help your buddy, because they love him as much as you do. Also, I'm not trying to be mean, or rude.
